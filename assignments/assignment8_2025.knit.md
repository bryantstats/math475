**Questions**

1. Simulate an AR(1) series with positive slope  using the `arima.sim` function. Plot the ACF of the series.  Comment on the ACF. 

2. Simulate an AR(1) series with negative slope  using the `arima.sim` function. Plot the ACF of the series.  Comment on the ACF. 

3. Simulate an AR(1) series.  Use the `arima` function to estimate the coefficients of the series.  Increase the length of the series to see if that improves the accuracy of the estimation.  

4. Simulate an AR(1) series. Plot the ACF of the residual.  Does the ACF of the residual look like that of white noise?  Plot the series and the estimated series in the same plot with the forecasting of 10 points to the future.
