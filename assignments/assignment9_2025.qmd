### Question 1. Differencing Techniques

Notice: See [this slides](https://bryantstats.github.io/math475/slides/7.html#35) for a similar example. 

-   Plot the ACF for the Microsoft stock series for 2023. Investigate the stationarity of the series.

-   Using the differencing technique to forecast the next value of the stock series.

### Question 2. AR(p)

- Consider the AMD stock from 2022 to present. Use the PACF plot to suggest an AR(p) model to model the stock.  Use the model to make a forecast for the next 5 values.  Plot the forecasting. 

- Redo the above analysis on another stock.
