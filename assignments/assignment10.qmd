### Questions

Working with the [inflation data](inflation.csv). The dataset contains monthly observations in the US from 1950-2 to 1990-12.  A time series containing :

- pai1: one-month inflation rate (in percent, annual rate)

- pai3: three-month inflation rate (in percent, annual rate)

- tb1: one-month T-bill rate (in percent, annual rate)

- tb3: three-month T-bill rate (in percent, annual rate)

- cpi: CPI for urban consumers, all items (the 1982-1984 average is set to 100)

**Do the follows.**

-   Create a time series of one month T-bill rate (which is the variable `tb1`)

-   Plot the time series

-   Plot the Exponential Smoothing with the weight of .1

-   Create a training time series where the time is from 1950-1985

-   Model the training series using the ARIMA(1,1,1) and plot the forecast

-   Use the model to make forecast for the next years of 1986-1990

-   Export the forecast to Excel and calculate the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the forecasting.
