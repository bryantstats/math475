1,"What Mathematicians and Statisticians Do
About this section
Mathematicians
Mathematicians and statisticians work with formulas and data to help solve problems in industry, academia, and government.
Mathematicians and statisticians analyze data and apply computational techniques to solve problems.

Duties
Mathematicians and statisticians typically do the following:

Decide what data are needed to answer specific questions or problems
Apply mathematical theories and techniques to solve practical problems in business, engineering, the sciences, and other fields
Design surveys, experiments, or opinion polls to collect data 
Develop mathematical or statistical models to analyze data
Interpret data and communicate analyses to technical and nontechnical audiences
Use statistical software to analyze data and create visualizations to aid decision making in business
To solve problems, mathematicians rely on statisticians to design surveys, questionnaires, experiments, and opinion polls for collecting the data they need. For most surveys and opinion polls, statisticians gather data from some people in a particular group. Statisticians determine the type and size of this sample for collecting data in the survey or poll.

Following data collection is analysis, which involves mathematicians and statisticians using specialized statistical software. In their analyses, mathematicians and statisticians identify trends and relationships within the data. They also conduct tests to determine the data’s validity and to account for possible errors. Some help write software code to analyze data more accurately and efficiently.

Mathematicians and statisticians present findings from their analyses and discuss the data’s limitations in order to ensure accurate interpretation. They may present written reports, tables, and charts to team members, clients, and other users.

Mathematicians and statisticians work in any field that benefits from data analysis, including education, government, healthcare, and research and development.

Colleges and universities. Mathematicians and statisticians working in postsecondary schools may study theoretical or abstract concepts in these fields. They identify, research, and work to resolve unexplained issues in mathematics and explore mathematical or statistical theories to increase knowledge and understanding about the field.

Government. Mathematicians and statisticians working in government develop surveys and collect and analyze data on a variety of topics, including employment, crop production, and energy use. At all levels of government, these data help to inform policy proposals and decisions that affect the public.

Healthcare. Statisticians known as biostatisticians or biometricians work in pharmaceutical companies, public health agencies, or hospitals. They may design studies to test whether drugs successfully treat diseases or medical conditions. They may also help identify the sources of outbreaks of illnesses in humans and animals.

Research and development. Mathematicians and statisticians design experiments for product testing and development. For example, they may help design experiments to see how car engines perform when exposed to extreme weather or analyze consumer data for use in developing marketing strategies. 

Typically, mathematicians and statisticians work on teams with other specialists to solve problems. For example, they may work with chemists, materials scientists, and chemical engineers to analyze the effectiveness of a new drug or help data scientists develop statistical models.

2,"Moving day is usually reserved for those quiet Saturdays in Augusta, Georgia, but the NBA turned its own back nine into a huge roar Sunday, with scoreboard watching, ducking and dodging, and, finally, a clear playoff picture. Well, clear-ish, considering there’s still the matter of a compelling play-in tournament featuring stars galore.

The rest of the league can take a collective breath before ramping back up next weekend. It’s an earned one considering how wild it's been since after the All-Star break — the usual malaise and situational tanking being replaced by scenarios and tiebreakers. Hardly anyone could truly cruise to the finish line, except for the Boston Celtics.

Never in the league’s rich history was there a day like Sunday, where the Western Conference's top seed could’ve gone to one of three teams on the season’s last day, and the bottom of the bracket was just as intriguing and, at times, puzzling.

Who could’ve expected the youthful Oklahoma City Thunder to watch as the defending champion Denver Nuggets tumbled and the surprising Minnesota Timberwolves stumbled to the finish line? If anything, it’s supposed to be the youth that wilts under the specter of playoff pressure.

Desperation was on display, in the case of the Phoenix Suns, who wanted to avoid the chance of the play-in. And when the Timberwolves didn’t look as if they wanted to take advantage of winning the conference, a showdown was set up, a potential rivalry having seeds sown.

OKC, the second-youngest team in the NBA, is the No. 1 seed in the West. (AP Photo/Kyle Phillips)
So, it’s the Thunder who appear to have the poise of a veteran team, and even though it’ll be very easy to evoke the memories of the now gray-beard Kevin Durant and Co. in OKC, this version feels more like Magic — as in that Orlando Magic team that rode the wave of a smooth guard named Penny (and that Shaq fella) to the NBA Finals in 1995.

If you squint, you’ll see some similarities between Penny Hardaway and OKC’s MVP candidate, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who shouldn’t be easily written off in the individual awards race or the race to get to June.

Speaking of the Magic, Orlando entered Sunday a series of results away from either finishing fifth or falling all the way to eighth, in the play-in and starting on the road. They’ll play a Cavs team that had an invincible stretch sandwiched around inconsistency, a team that could’ve finished second but sits fourth in a series that many will label as an afterthought but shouldn’t be.

It feels like the New York Knicks aren’t being rewarded here. Playing 82 playoff games under Tom Thibodeau, bodies dropping left and right yet somehow standing tall as a unit, then having to possibly face the league’s biggest skyscraper in Joel Embiid if Philadelphia beats Miami in the 7-8 play-in, doesn’t quite feel like justice as they finally dismissed the pesky Chicago Bulls — in a game that, had they lost, they would’ve earned the “easier” draw.

But these are the breaks of the playoffs — and it’s Thibs, who’d sell his soul and your mother’s for a win, so let’s be honest here. And being deserving of a break doesn’t apply when it comes to high-stakes competition. It means if they emerge from this circumstance, their validity won’t be questioned.

The last champion to emerge from the East was the Milwaukee Bucks in 2021. Sure, they caught a break in the conference finals by playing the novice Atlanta Hawks, but they went through the feared Miami Heat in the first round, sweeping them, before going against the team everyone thought would walk to the Finals — the Durant-led Brooklyn Nets.

3,"Data scientists use analytical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.

Duties
Data scientists typically do the following:

Determine which data are available and useful for the project
Collect, categorize, and analyze data
Create, validate, test, and update algorithms and models
Use data visualization software to present findings
Make business recommendations to stakeholders based on data analysis
Data scientists often begin a project by gathering or identifying relevant data sources, such as surveys. They may use a variety of methods to obtain data, including through access to other organizations’ databases or by using web-scraping tools (software that extracts specific information from websites). They may start with large, unstructured datasets, commonly referred to as raw data. To properly analyze the data, these scientists must “clean” the raw data, a process by which they structure the data to make them readable by software programs.

Data scientists develop algorithms (sets of instructions that tell computers what to do) and models to support programs for machine learning. They use machine learning to classify or categorize data or to make predictions related to the models. Scientists also must test the algorithms and models for accuracy, including for updates with newly collected data.

Data scientists often use data visualization software to present their findings as charts, maps, and other graphics. Visualization techniques allow data scientists to clearly communicate their analyses to technical and nontechnical audiences, including colleagues, managers, and clients. Ensuring that audiences understand the information helps data scientists make recommendations for business decisions or process changes based on the results of their analysis.

Some data scientists choose to focus on a particular area of work. For example, data scientists who have a strong coding or engineering background may develop or recommend systems, build machine learning algorithms, and devise ways to enhance web-browsing functions. Others conduct research for reports or academic journals. Still others focus on improving business strategy for activities such as marketing, sales, and user engagement.

4,"What Actuaries Do
About this section
Actuaries
Actuaries produce charts, tables, and reports to explain their calculations.
Actuaries analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty. They use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to assess the risk of potential events, and they help businesses and clients develop policies that minimize the cost of that risk. Actuaries’ work is essential to the insurance industry.

Duties
Actuaries typically do the following:

Compile and analyze statistical data and other information
Estimate the probability and likely economic cost of an event such as death, sickness, an accident, or a natural disaster
Design and test insurance policies, investments, and other business strategies to minimize risk and maximize profitability
Calculate cash reserves needed, based on existing policies and liabilities, in case of payout or claims
Produce charts, tables, and reports that explain calculations and proposals
Explain their findings and proposals to company executives, government officials, shareholders, and clients
Actuaries use database software to compile information. They use statistical and modeling software to forecast the probability of an event occurring, the potential costs of the event if it does occur, and whether the insurance company has enough money to pay future claims.

Actuaries typically work on teams that often include managers and workers from other fields, such as accounting, underwriting, and finance. For example, some actuaries work with accountants and financial analysts to set the price for security offerings or with data scientists to forecast demand for new products.

Most actuaries work for insurance companies, where they help design policies and determine the premiums that should be charged for each policy. They must ensure that the premiums are profitable yet competitive with other insurance companies.

Some actuaries work as consultants and provide advice to clients on a contract basis. Many consulting actuaries audit the work of internal actuaries at insurance companies or handle actuarial duties for insurance companies that are not large enough to keep their own actuaries on staff.

Actuaries in the insurance industry typically specialize in one field of insurance, such as the following:

Health insurance actuaries help develop long-term care and health insurance policies by predicting expected costs of providing care under the terms of an insurance contract. Their predictions are based on numerous factors, including family history, geographic location, and occupation.

Life insurance actuaries help develop annuity and life insurance policies for individuals and groups by creating estimates of how long someone will live. These estimates are based on risk factors, such as age and tobacco use.

Property and casualty insurance actuaries help develop policies that insure policyholders against property loss and liability resulting from accidents, natural disasters, fires, and other events. For example, they calculate the expected number of claims resulting from automobile accidents, which varies with the insured person’s age, driving history, type of car, and other factors.

Some actuaries apply their expertise to financial matters outside of the insurance industry. For example, they develop investment strategies that manage risks and maximize returns for companies or individuals. Actuaries outside of the insurance industry include the following:

Enterprise risk management actuaries identify risks, including economic, financial, and geopolitical risks that may affect a company’s short-term or long-term objectives. They help top executives determine how much risk the business is willing to take, and they develop strategies to mitigate the financial impact of those risks.

Pension and retirement benefits actuaries design, test, and evaluate company pension plans to determine if funds available in the future will be enough to ensure payment of benefits. They must report the results of their evaluations to the federal government. Pension actuaries also help businesses develop other types of retirement benefits, such as 401(k)s and healthcare plans for retirees. In addition, they provide retirement planning advice to individuals.

Public sector actuaries have different duties, based on the level of government in which they work. In the federal government, actuaries may evaluate proposed changes to Social Security or Medicare or conduct economic and demographic studies to project benefit obligations. At the state level, actuaries may examine and regulate the rates charged by insurance companies.

5,"There's a belief that basketball produces a somewhat predictable postseason. The thought is that across a seven-game series, the best team has a longer sample to prove its worth than in, say, the single-elimination format of football. Hot pitching and goaltending can produce wild results in baseball and hockey, but basketball is widely considered to be a more stable sport. The best team, more often than not, will emerge victorious.

Well, lately at least, that belief has proven misguided. Remember, a play-in team reached the NBA Finals only a year ago when the Miami Heat won the Eastern Conference. Yet another play-in team in the Los Angeles Lakers reached the conference finals. Since 2009, we have seen only one NBA Finals series in which both No. 1 seeds won their conferences. That came all the way back in 2016. The No. 1 overall seed has not won a championship since the Golden State Warriors did so in 2017.

The modern NBA playoffs are a minefield. One sprained ankle can end a season. Shooting variance has never mattered more in a 3-pointer-obsessed league. No sport is as matchup-dependent. No sport changes as much between the regular season and the playoffs.

So keep that in mind as you browse our staff brackets for the 2024 NBA postseason. We all may have taken different roads to get there, but we all emerged in the same place. If recent history tells us anything, it's that the actual postseason will be far more complicated than our brackets suggest they will be.

NBA Finals pick: Nuggets over Celtics. Denver spending the majority of the season on autopilot doesn't change the fact that it is the best team and Nikola Jokic is the best player. What a series this would be, but in the end the Nuggets are just more reliable in the high-leverage possessions. Jokic is an indefensible dilemma: Cover him straight up and he bludgeons you as a scorer, double him and he slices you up as a passer. And on the rare possessions that the Jokic riddle gets solved, I'll take Jamal Murray creating individual offense over any Celtic. That's not a knock on Jayson Tatum; Murray is just that deadly in the playoffs. If you broke this series down with a ledger, Boston might well have more check marks on its side. But on the court, Denver still ends with the ring.

6,"The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated April 20, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, April 16. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


“Like That,” on Boominati/Freebandz/Republic/Epic Records, drew 40 million streams (down 13%) and 14 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 39%) and sold 3,000 (down 56%) April 5-11.

The single adds a third week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; drops 8-14 on Digital Song Sales; and debuts at No. 41 on Radio Songs.

Notably, “Like That” is the first song to clear 40 million in streams in its first three weeks, after it registered 46.1 million the week before and 59.6 million in its debut week, since Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” began with 52.6 million, 59.7 million and 48 million consecutively in January-February 2023. Among hip-hop hits (defined as those that have appeared on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart), “Like That” is the first to achieve the feat since Cardi B’s “WAP,” featuring Megan Thee Stallion, did so in its first six weeks in August-September 2020.

Plus, “Like That” is the first song to spend its first three weeks on the Hot 100 at No. 1 since “Flowers” logged its first six weeks in charge in January-March 2023. Among hip-hop entries, “Like That” is the first title to claim No. 1 in its first three chart weeks since Drake’s “Nice for What” dominated in its first four frames in April-May 2018.

Further, “Like That” is the first song to log any three consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in over nine months, since Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night” linked 10 frames in a row on top (of 16 total) in May-July 2023. The streak of 38 weeks between songs’ commands of at least three uninterrupted weeks, between “Last Night” and “Like That,” marks the longest in the Hot 100’s 65-year history. (In that 38-week stretch, five songs each led for at least three weeks, just not consecutively, led by six weeks on top for Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me”; plus, 10 songs debuted at No. 1 in that span.)

“Like That” concurrently tops the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, which use the same multimetric methodology as the Hot 100, for a third week each.

Friday Music Guide: New Music From Future & Metro Boomin, Dua Lipa, Sabrina Carpenter…
04/15/2024
Two weeks earlier, “Like That” blasted in at No. 1 on the Hot 100 as Future and Lamar’s third leader each and Metro Boomin’s first as a billed recording artist (following two as a writer and producer), as parent LP We Don’t Trust You by Future and Metro Boomin bounded in atop the Billboard 200. (The set’s sequel, We Still Don’t Trust You, was released April 12 and will impact next week’s charts, dated April 27.)

Hozier’s “Too Sweet” ascends 4-2 on the Hot 100, winning top Streaming Gainer honors (36.7 million, up 15%). The singer-songwriter ties his prior best rank on the chart, as his breakthrough hit “Take Me to Church” peaked at No. 2 for three weeks in December 2014-January 2015. “Too Sweet” concurrently leads the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts for a third week each.

Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2, as it earns the chart’s top Airplay Gainer award for a third consecutive week (57.4 million, up 14%).

Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” rises 5-4 on the Hot 100, three weeks after becoming his first No. 1. The single likewise becomes his first leader on Radio Songs (69.7 million, up 6%).

Beyoncé’s ‘Cowboy Carter’ Scores Second Week Atop Billboard 200
04/15/2024
Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” slides 2-5 on the Hot 100, after it reigned for two weeks in early March. It rules the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart for a ninth week, as her album Cowboy Carter tops the Billboard 200 for a second week.

J. Cole’s “7 Minute Drill” debuts at No. 6 on the Hot 100, led by 23.4 million streams. The song is his 13th top 10 and first since Drake’s “First Person Shooter,” on which he’s featured, debuted at No. 1 in October 2023, becoming his first leader.

On “7 Minute Drill,” J. Cole is widely interpreted as responding to Kendrick Lamar’s apparent disses directed at himself and Drake in Future, Metro Boomin and Lamar’s “Like That.” Days after  releasing “7 Minute Drill,” J. Cole publicly apologized for the track’s arrival, explaining that it doesn’t “sit right with my spirit.” The song was removed from the streaming edition of his album Might Delete Later on April 12, one day after the end of the latest charts’ tracking week. (As of April 15, the song is still available on the set’s digital download edition.)

Rounding out the Hot 100’s top 10, Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” rebounds 8-7, following, as noted above, six nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1, beginning last December; Ariana Grande’s “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” climbs 9-8, after it debuted at No. 1 in March; Future, Metro Boomin, Travis Scott and Playboi Carti’s “Type Shit” lifts 10-9, after it arrived at its No. 2 best; and Noah Kahan’s first top 10, “Stick Season,” returns to the region and its highest rank (15-10).

Again, for all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on Billboard’s social accounts, and all charts (dated April 20), including the Hot 100 in its entirety, will refresh on Billboard.com tomorrow (April 16).
