**Questions**

1.  Use the codes in the slides to plot the ACF of (you can use your own dataset or use simulated time series)

-   a white-noise that follows the standard normal distribution (using `rnorm` function)

-   a time series with trend

-   a time series with seasonality

-   a time series with trend and seasonality

Comment on the difference between the ACF of the white-noise and other time series.

2.  Use the codes in the slides to simulate a different random walk $y_t$ and

-   plot the random walk $y_t$

-   plot the ACF of the random walk

-   plot the differencing of $y_t$

-   plot the ACF of the differencing of $y_t$

3.  Use the codes in the slides to simulate a different random walk $y_t$ with drift 2024 and

-   plot the random walk $y_t$

-   plot the ACF of the random walk

-   plot the differencing of $y_t$

-   plot the ACF of the differencing of $y_t$

3.  Use the codes in the slides to plot the stock of Apple. Also

-   Plot the ACF of the stock.

-   Plot the differencing of the stock

-   Plot the ACF of the differencing of the stock

-   Is it reasonable to assume that Apple stock following the random walk model?

4.  Find other stocks that may be following the random walk model.
