# Time Series Patterns

A time series may consist of

-   trend,

-   seasonality and

-   cycles

# Trend

-   A trend is a long-term increase or decrease in the data.

-   Trend does not have to be linear.

-   Sometimes we will refer to a trend as “changing direction”, when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.

# Examples

-   The US treasury bill contracts show results from the Chicago market for 100 consecutive trading days in 1981. There is a downward trend

# Examples

![](images/ts7.png)

-   There is no apparent trend in the data over this period

# Cycle and Seasonal

-   cycle: repeated events over time that are not equally spaced

-   seasonal: repeated events over time that are equally spaced

# Examples

![](images/ts7.png)

-   The monthly housing sales show strong seasonality within each year, as well as some strong cyclic behaviour with a period of about 6–10 years

# Examples

The Australian quarterly electricity production shows a strong increasing trend, with strong seasonality. There is no evidence of any cyclic behavior here

#

-   No trend, seasonality or cyclic behaviour. There are random fluctuations which do not appear to be very predictable, and no strong patterns that would help with developing a forecasting model.

# Time series decomposition

-   When we decompose a time series into components, we usually combine the trend and cycle into a single trend-cycle component (sometimes called the trend for simplicity).

-   Three components: a trend-cycle component, a seasonal component, and a remainder component (containing anything else in the time series).

# Two decompositions

-   Additive Decomposition

$$
y_t = S_t + T_t + R_t
$$

-   Multiplicative decomposition

$$
y_t = S_t\times T_t \times R_t
$$

# Relationship

-   The log transformation will turn a multiplicative model to additive model.

# Central MA vs. MA

# Classical Decomposition

-   Trend Estimate: Smooth the data using centred moving average (CMA) of the order equal to the periodicity of the data

-   Detrend the data: calculate the detrended series by subtracting/dividing the trend estimate

-   Seasonal Estimate: Average value for each period is calculated based on the de-trended series.

-   Random/Remainder: subtract from the series the trend and seasonal component estimations

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
plot(AirPassengers)
```

# 

```{r}
ourDecomposition <- decompose(AirPassengers, type="additive")
plot(ourDecomposition)
```

# 

```{r}
ourDecomposition <- decompose(AirPassengers, type="multiplicative")
plot(ourDecomposition)
```

# 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
y <- ts(c(1:100) + 
          50*cos(seq(0,16*pi,length.out=100)) + 
          rnorm(100,0,10),frequency=12)
```

# 

```{r}
y <- ts(c(1:100) + 50*cos(seq(0,16*pi,length.out=100)) + rnorm(100,0,10),frequency=12)
ourDecomposition <- decompose(y, type="additive")
plot(ourDecomposition)
```

# STL Decomposition

-   Classical Decomposition uses Central Moving Average to estimate the trend

-   STL uses LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) to estimate the trend

-   [Link](https://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf)

-   The seasonal component is estimated using moving averages of the de-trend series

# 

-   STL is a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series

-   STL can be implemented using `stl` function

# 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data("AirPassengers")
stl_Decomposition <- stl(AirPassengers, 
                        s.window = "periodic")
plot(stl_Decomposition)
```

# 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data("AirPassengers")
ourDecomposition <- stl(AirPassengers, s.window = "periodic")
plot(ourDecomposition)
```

# Other Decomposition Methods

-   X-11 decomposition: originated in the US Census Bureau and Statistics Canada

-   SEATS decomposition: developed at the Bank of Spain, and is now widely used by government agencies around the world
