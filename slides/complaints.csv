01/30/21,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"This past Fall I refinanced my VA Mortgage that has been held with XXXXXXXX XXXX. I reached out to XXXX in XXXX to inquire about VA IRRL options but settled on XXXX due to more competitive rates. I began receiving calls multiple times a week from XXXX in XXXX to try and get me to refinance with them as well. As those calls and voicemails continued through XXXX and XXXX I received two voicemails that my account was passed due. I contacted XXXX and was directed to the refinance team, who again was trying to sell me on a XXXX refinance and told me my loan was in good standing. I continued my refinance with XXXX XXXX and was scheduled to close in XXXX, but was delayed three times all the way to XX/XX/2020, due to XXXX XXXX being behind on closings. I continued to pay my current XXXXXXXX XXXX in the process to ensure no payments were missed in the transition. 

I was notified again by voicemail in early XXXX that I had a past due XXXX  bill, which surprised me as I had seen my check to XXXX  for the month clear. I called them back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that I had {$64.00} past due balance on my over $ XXXX  monthly mortgage payment, based on a change to my escrow amount that I was previously unaware of. I sent payment that day which was received and cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. I inquired as to why my escrow payment was increased when I would be getting a check to close that account within a month. They wanted me to send them {$64.00} when they were going to turn around and send me a check for over {$2000.00} within a couple weeks since that account was in the process of being closed and no more payments would be made from it. I was told by the XXXX agent on the XXXX that this would not be reported to the credit agency. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that my credit report showed a late payment to XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX who said that the escrow was recalculated in XXXX and a notification was sent. He said he could see that notifications were sent again in XXXX but noted that he could see that they were returned. I believe those notices, just like my escrow refund check which was sent to me by XXXX in XXXX, was sent to the wrong address. 

I was in the midst of refinancing and XXXX had already sent out my payoff notification to XXXX XXXX and were actively trying to get me to refinance with them instead. The XXXX sales team and account management teams failed to share information and provided me incorrect information as a customer.

This status has remained each time I logged in over the past year so I finally called on XX/XX/XXXX to find out what was going on. It turns out someone else was able to change the name associated with my credit to his name. As such, Transunion placed a security watch on my account and left it as 'UNKNOWN ' ever since. Several things are wrong here : 1. The controls Transunion has in place failed and someone was able to change my name to his. Shouldn't there be a hard stop in the system to prevent this without manual updates from a Transunion rep using support documents to allow this change? 
2. I was NEVER notified of this fraud occurrence. This is another control failure. Shouldn't the impacted consumer be notified?

After providing all my personal info including social security number and other identifying information, individual on the other line told me could not find my account. After an hour with this person, was told they don't service my loan and no idea how I was transferred to them ... this after taking all my identifying information!! I called Loan Depot back to relate what happened and was told 'sorry - don't know how that happened '. That was it - no attempt to fix it or find out who it was I was transferred to in order to be sure information was safe. Have been sent round and round being transferred back and forth to customer service. 
This company continues to have problems processing payment. I removed automatic payment in order to make payment over the phone so account would not be affected. They provided credit reporting bureaus with information that I have not paid but have and continue to do so but they do not process. I was declined a credit card ( rating had been in the 700s ) because rating dropped to low 600s ( XXXX points! ) due to their incorrect reporting and inability to rectify issues on their end.

Sec. 1681 ( a ) ). Upon reviewing a copy of my credit report, I have identified discrepancies and concerns regarding the accuracy of information related to the accounts referenced below I recently submitted a dispute letter to Experian, including all the necessary documentation to verify my identity and support my claim. However, I received an email response from Experian stating that they can not complete the investigation due to the alleged absence of copies of my Social Security Number ( SSN ) and identification. 

I would like to clarify that I did, in fact, include all the required documentation with my initial dispute letter. Enclosed with my certified letter to Experian were copies of my driver 's license, Social Security card, and lease agreement, all of which serve as valid proof of my identity and address. I have attached the proof of delivery for your reference. 

It is disheartening to encounter such oversight and disregard for the accuracy and thorough review of the documentation provided. These errors and inaccurate reporting on my credit report have significant consequences on my daily life, hindering my ability to secure loans, obtain housing, and even acquire necessary means of transportation. 

Furthermore, I request the immediate deletion of the unverified and closed accounts listed below : 1. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( {$810.00} ) 2. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( {$0.00} ) 3. XXXX, XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( {$1000.00} ) I kindly request your intervention in this matter to ensure that Experian conducts a thorough investigation, rectifies their oversight, and takes immediate action to update and correct the inaccurate information on my credit report. These actions are necessary to restore the integrity and accuracy of my credit profile and protect my consumer rights. Also they mentioned the inquiry may take 45 days?? Isnt the max 30 days? How is this okay? 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and ask that you keep me informed of any actions taken in response to my complaint. Thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.

I have been working very hard to bring my score up and every time I do the credit agencies allow a company to put a fraudulent account on my report. I then contact all three agencies to advise/dispute and they answer with the debt is valid. To which three times I have had to reach out to your office to request assistance. 

Then once these negative items are removed my credit report the score is not increasing/adjusting for the change. There have been instances where I have paid the debts and an agency like XXXX XXXX has advised my score will increase 25+ points and nothing. 

I have done everything in my power to try and jump from poor/fair to good credit and no matter how i try i keep getting knocked back down to the 500s. I feel as though this is the credit agencies attempt to try and keep my score low. As I will then be forced to pay higher interest rates. I would like to request an audit of my credit profile. Please help me I am sure they are mistakenly keeping my credit score low. If I am wrong I will accept this, but i would like some help with making this right.

07/31/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I was contacted earlier this year by a person claiming to represent XXXX stating that I had a past due balance on my account. At that time, I was unaware of any balance due, and had already turned in this leased vehicle to the dealership months earlier, in favor of a renewed lease on a newer vehicle. While speaking to the agent on the phone, I logged into my account at XXXX, and saw that I have a {$0.00} balance. My most recent statement for this account was dated XX/XX/2019 and showed Total Amount Due {$0.00}. 
Considering I had an unknown person calling me unsolicited and asking for money, while giving me conflicting information from what my online statement showed me, obviously this raised red flags. The agent was unable to tell me why my online account showed no balance due, or what the amount owed was for. The agent advised they would mail me an invoice showing me the balance due, which I agreed to review and pay if it was in fact legitimate. 
This invoice never arrived. I have still yet to receive any piece of paper showing what the balance owed is for. 
Moving forward, I have been in the process of refinancing my home. Earlier this month, my mortgage broker advised me that they noticed a sharp drop in my credit score from one day to the next. I immediately reviewed my credit report to find that XXXX reported my account as seriously delinquent, for a vehicle I had turned in more than six months ago, and for an account to which I have no statement showing I owe any money. To add to this, my account was enrolled in autopay, which served to pay any balance for the duration of my lease. Any money owed should have just been debited from my account, but that is not what happened. 
I have since attempted to resolve this matter with XXXX XXXX XXXX over the phone over multiple occasions. I was transferred, hung up on, and lied to. I was told I would receive a call back from a manager within 72 hours, only to find out a week later that no managers make outbound calls, and that there was no record of that request on my account. 
I have since paid the balance due, despite still not seeing any invoice to indicate what it was for, as my concern for the $ 300+ dollars that I was told I owed is far less than the impact this has taken on my credit report. I have worked very diligently throughout my life to maintain a flawless credit score, however this incident has taken me from over 800, to in the 600s at the time of this writing. I am in the process of trying to refinance my home, and this incident is severely impacting my ability to do so, and in turn costing me FAR more money than the {$300.00} XXXX requested ( and in turn received ) from me. 
I have now sent a letter in writing to XXXX, as I was told this is the only method I am able to communicate with their disputes department. I initiated a dispute with Transunion when this first appeared ealier this month, however just today this has now appeared on my XXXX   report as well, despite having already been paid!

I have been working very hard to bring my score up and every time I do the credit agencies allow a company to put a fraudulent account on my report. I then contact all three agencies to advise/dispute and they answer with the debt is valid. To which three times I have had to reach out to your office to request assistance.

Then once these negative items are removed my credit report the score is not increasing/adjusting for the change. There have been instances where I have paid the debts and an agency like XXXX XXXX has advised my score will increase 25+ points and nothing.

I have done everything in my power to try and jump from poor/fair to good credit and no matter how i try i keep getting knocked back down to the 500s. I feel as though this is the credit agencies attempt to try and keep my score low. As I will then be forced to pay higher interest rates. I would like to request an audit of my credit profile. Please help me I am sure they are mistakenly keeping my credit score low. If I am wrong I will accept this, but i would like some help with making this right.

I then went to the XXXX website ( same day ) and spoke to XXXX ( Agent ) via Chat feature and explained everything that transpired and my conversation with XXXX and XXXX at CB Indigo.

Once either of those had been filed then I would need to send it to XXXX for them to get the legal authorization to remove the Hard Inquiry.

I have been working very hard to bring my score up and every time I do the credit agencies allow a company to put a fraudulent account on my report. I then contact all three agencies to advise/dispute and they answer with the debt is valid. To which three times I have had to reach out to your office to request assistance. 

Then once these negative items are removed my credit report the score is not increasing/adjusting for the change. There have been instances where I have paid the debts and an agency like XXXX XXXX has advised my score will increase 25+ points and nothing. 

I have done everything in my power to try and jump from poor/fair to good credit and no matter how i try i keep getting knocked back down to the 500s. I feel as though this is the credit agencies attempt to try and keep my score low. As I will then be forced to pay higher interest rates. I would like to request an audit of my credit profile. Please help me I am sure they are mistakenly keeping my credit score low. If I am wrong I will accept this, but i would like some help with making this right.

I did not notice that I had my XXXX monthly renewal plan linked to this credit card, which was the only fee I had with this card, and so I oversaw the payment.

There is additional correspondence w/ XXXX  that can be provided upon request, along with my LiveChat transcript to confirm the non-delivery of goods with XXXX  - only the company FAQ page was provided, and the Return Policy, which XXXX claimed that this inquiry fell outside of. 

When I reached out to XXXX originally on XX/XX/2022, they had provided a window for delivery between XX/XX/XXXX which happened to fall on a Saturday ( XX/XX/2022 ). When it was confirmed to me that the package was delivered to the incorrect location on XX/XX/2022 ( they would attempt to recover the package, which failed ), I was informed that I should reach out to the vendor or shipper. However, the XXXX team for XX/XX/XXXXwas unavailable on Saturday. When I initiated the claim withXX/XX/XXXXto dispute the loan and begin the investigation to confirm delivery with XX/XX/XXXXon the following Monday, XX/XX/2022, they had failed to update the claim until the FOLLOWING Monday, XX/XX/2022. At this point, XXXX has and will only provide the Confirmation of Delivery page attached which provides a link to the XXXX XXXX tracking page. Upon additional confirmation, the provided document ( attached ) only shows Delivery to Service Area XXXX, MA without any signature provided. It has been confirmed on this XXXX tracking # XXXX & XXXX Claim Reference Number XXXX that the package has been lost/stolen in transit. However, they confirmed an inquiry into either of these provided reference numbers by the vendor or shipper would be required to further process a refund ( on the loan to XX/XX/XXXX ) by the courier due to the package being lost/stolen in transit ( indicated on the provided correspondence w/ XXXX attached ) XXXX 

This claim was never followed up on, nor was it properly investigated by XXXX or XXXX. The provider for the goods, XXXX, did not provide an adequate response to the initial investigation by XX/XX/XXXX, and after numerous follow-ups with both companies since XX/XX/2022, I have formally filed complaints against both companies with the XX/XX/XXXX and I have contacted the local Consumer Protection Bureau through the RI Attorney General 's office for additional guidance. I am currently investigating this further with assistance from XXXX XXXX, as XXXX is now reporting a delinquent payment for the existing loan on these goods to Experian on behalf of the creditor. 

I do not understand how an individual is held liable for payments on goods/services that were never rendered, and how the investigation and claim on my end hold no weight in the formal outcome for the numerous disputes I have filed over the past 6 months. 



When I was able to get in touch with a XX/XX/XXXX customer service representative the following week on XX/XX/2022 via Live Chat, they provided the FAQ links for the company and refused to provide an email for me to have been able to formally report a missing shipment within a reasonable timeframe. 

I did reach out to XXXX on XXXX, XXXX - XXXX, XX/XX/XXXXvia Live Chat the only available way to contact a representative - however, there is only an automated chat response outside of their regular business hours that does not provide an email or follow up correspondence to confirm with a live representative after the fact, so I had waited for the formal dispute with XX/XX/XXXX to upload in their system to highlight the dispute with the payment ( loan ) processor and claim with XXXX. 

To date, they hold that they are within their return policy and have only provide the Confirmation of Delivery page attached with the link to the provided XXXX documents, without acknowledging or investigating the additional response from XXXX that had been initiated via my intial call to check on the status of the shipment on XX/XX/2022.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,RI,02861,None,Consent provided,Web,05/05/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6937323

This is an additional complaint and supplementary information I have noticed. Per the attachment, there was a posted payment of {$13000.00} on XX/XX/2021 by whomever the account holder. The account balance at that time was {$4000.00} dollars. The high credit and original loan amount of whoever 's account this is was {$9000.00}. This is the posted unanimous information being reported amongst all three major credit bureaus. Can you please advise how with an original balance of {$9000.00} would have a past due balance with a posted unanimous payment of {$13000.00} amongst all three bureaus in addition to a perfect payment history? Further, XXXX and XXXX reflect late payments after the account should have been XXXX 'd out. It also appears possibly XXXX and XXXX XXXX reflect payments as well. The difference of {$4000.00} and a {$13000.00} payment is positive and should not reflect late payments to whomever the account holder is. I feel the payment history should be thoroughly reviewed. 

Companies that provide information to consumer reporting agencies also have specific legal obligations, including the duty to investigate disputed information. I have been denied this right. Anyone actually looking over the information would notice none of the numbers make any sense. Simply asking the company "" oh is that correct '' is not proper due diligence nor an acceptable response. This information can be taken directly off of the credit report without even contacting any company. The account is riddled with inconsistencies and for that fact alone it needs to be removed. This request is further supplemented by the following definitions all of which are met. 

An account whose status is paid in full, and thus has no balance due but nevertheless reflects a balance due ; An account that reflects an Original Loan Amount that increases over time, an impossibility by definition ; Derogatory information being reported on an account, although that derogatory information predates an earlier report that did not include the derogatory information. 

The account is not mine and I do not owe them anything. The account is riddled with illogical reporting. My credit has always been perfect across the board never a single late payment. I notice a false account on my reports and I dispute it and then all of a sudden you want to retaliatorily change loan amounts and past due balances and throw late payments on there. I have copies of all the prior credit reports. There was never a late payment reported or derogatory information in any prior reports until I stated the balance was not mine. The changes to the report were done in malice. My information was also leaked and documentation to support that has also been submitted. I do not know what it is but what I do know is that none of it is correct. 

The bureaus have a duty to report accurate information and the misreporting of such information is misutilization of my information and a violation of the fair credit reporting act. Further, this is a misrepresentation of my character which has done me economic harm and damages and I want the account removed immediately. I would say an additional 17 months now I have been forced to be a renter due to improper credit reporting at a current market rent of {$1200.00}. ( {$21000.00} ). I have other large personal obligations that have either had to close at above market rates or were not able to close. 

Look at my perfect credit history exclusive of that account, over ~12 years of perfect payments. You are denying me the right to seek a home or other credit predicated on comical posted transactional history, illogical reporting, and retaliatory practices. I would venture to say the aforementioned may possibly constitute negligent noncompliance with the fair credit reporting act.

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX on finally received the funds from XXXX to pay off my account to them. Attach is a copy of the check I sent to them for final payoff. The balance transfer fee was waived by Citicards so my balance owe is XXXX. Below is a summary of all correspondence with Citicards and XXXX XXXX. You may reach out to the contacts from XXXX XXXX  to verify this incident. 
I filed a XXXX transfer online with CITI cards. The amount was for {$7700.00} to be transferred to the consumer 's XXXX Bank account. However, the consumer accidentally gave them the wrong account number. The consumer had XXXX accounts and that one was closed. XXXX then sent back the funds to Citicard through a check in the mail on XXXX XXXX. The check was cashed/deposited on XXXX XXXX XXXX. The consumer has a copy of this check from XXXX. Citicard says they never cashed it but XXXX XXXX  says they did. Almost XXXX year later and the consumer can't get it fixed. Citicard has been sending the consumer bills and has ruined the consumer 's XXXX XXXX. The consumer never received any funds from them but still they request payment.

There is additional correspondence w/ Affirm that can be provided upon request, along with my LiveChat transcript to confirm the non-delivery of goods with XXXX - only the company FAQ page was provided, and the Return Policy, which XXXX claimed that this inquiry fell outside of. 

When I reached out to XXXX originally on XX/XX/2022, they had provided a window for delivery between XX/XX/XXXX which happened to fall on a Saturday ( XX/XX/2022 ). When it was confirmed to me that the package was delivered to the incorrect location on XX/XX/2022 ( they would attempt to recover the package, which failed ), I was informed that I should reach out to the vendor or shipper. However, the XXXX team for XX/XX/XXXXwas unavailable on Saturday. When I initiated the claim with Affirm to dispute the loan and begin the investigation to confirm delivery with XX/XX/XXXXon the following Monday, XX/XX/2022, they had failed to update the claim until the FOLLOWING Monday, XX/XX/2022. At this point, XXXX has and will only provide the Confirmation of Delivery page attached which provides a link to the XXXX XXXX tracking page. Upon additional confirmation, the provided document ( attached ) only shows Delivery to Service Area XXXX, MA without any signature provided. It has been confirmed on this XXXX tracking # XXXX & XXXX Claim Reference Number XXXX that the package has been lost/stolen in transit. However, they confirmed an inquiry into either of these provided reference numbers by the vendor or shipper would be required to further process a refund ( on the loan to Affirm ) by the courier due to the package being lost/stolen in transit ( indicated on the provided correspondence w/ XXXX attached ) XXXX 

This claim was never followed up on, nor was it properly investigated by Affirm or XXXX. The provider for the goods, XXXX, did not provide an adequate response to the initial investigation by Affirm, and after numerous follow-ups with both companies since XX/XX/2022, I have formally filed complaints against both companies with the XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have contacted the local Consumer Protection Bureau through the RI Attorney General 's office for additional guidance. I am currently investigating this further with assistance from XXXX XXXX, as Affirm is now reporting a delinquent payment for the existing loan on these goods to XXXX on behalf of the creditor. 

I do not understand how an individual is held liable for payments on goods/services that were never rendered, and how the investigation and claim on my end hold no weight in the formal outcome for the numerous disputes I have filed over the past 6 months. 



When I was able to get in touch with a XXXX customer service representative the following week on XX/XX/2022 via Live Chat, they provided the FAQ links for the company and refused to provide an email for me to have been able to formally report a missing shipment within a reasonable timeframe. 

I did reach out to XXXX on XXXX, XXXX - XXXX, XXXX via Live Chat the only available way to contact a representative - however, there is only an automated chat response outside of their regular business hours that does not provide an email or follow up correspondence to confirm with a live representative after the fact, so I had waited for the formal dispute with Affirm to upload in their system to highlight the dispute with the payment ( loan ) processor and claim with XXXX. 

To date, they hold that they are within their return policy and have only provide the Confirmation of Delivery page attached with the link to the provided XXXX documents, without acknowledging or investigating the additional response from XXXX that had been initiated via my intial call to check on the status of the shipment on XX/XX/2022.",None,"Affirm Holdings, Inc",RI,02861,None,Consent provided,Web,05/05/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6934507

In XXXX I was going over my credit reports and noticed that the inquiry from XXXX was still showing and that there was now a second inquiry dating from XX/XX/XXXX.

This evening I received another alert from XXXX and once again there is a new hard inquiry on my credit report from Chase. 

I called them and was passed from person to person and finally spoke with the right department who said that the application came from XXXX. They assured me that they would deny the application and that they would send a request to have this inquiry also masked from my report.

I have also called numerous times same dates because I would go into the branch they would give me number because, "" they were unable to help me '' and I was on the phone for hours transferred to multiple times all while getting no where. Then one day recently XX/XX/XXXX I called to be transferred to 6 representatives when I finally got a nasty man XXXX XXXX agent number XXXX. That was a 4 hour conversation where I was transferred 6 times and they said there is nothing they can do because the account is in my name and closed. 

Back in XXXX I started working for XXXX XXXX, owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX XXXX. I was doing mostly office work helping him collect on past due accounts, I was in charge of payroll, ( Which never happened ) scheduling and sometimes I would go out into the field for estimates or to do work. He had mentioned to me that he was going to add me on the "" XXXX Bank account '' and make me a signer because we were getting into situations when he would want me to write checks and I told him I can not because it is not my account. Then one day in XXXX we went into a XXXX bank and we did just that, made me a signer. I made it clear on multiple occasions I just wanted to be a signer. That day when I was added XXXX account was already negative, I said this seems like a bad idea I don't want to go on this account as a signer when it is negative. He said a customer had written him a check and it will be handled. I believed him. 

Now fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX I have never written any checks out of that account nor did I ever have a debit card with my name on it. My issue is this was his account it is negative because of his negligence not mine. I had a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account for 19 years which now is closed and purged because XXXX XXXX wrote and deposited checks into my account and they were bogus. I have already filed charges against him and had to get multiple police reports because this man stole my identity and ruined my life in just under a year. He is now being held at the XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX where he is facing multiple larceny, stolen identity, and forgery charges. 

I need help resolving this issue so I can begin to get my life back. When I met him I had an XXXX credit score and the same bank account for 19 years. My credit score is now under a 5 and I am unable to get a bank account because of him.

11/23/22,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To Whom it May Concern, I have already filed a complaint. This is an additional complaint and supplementary information I have noticed. Per the attachment, there was a posted payment of {$13000.00} on XX/XX/2021 by whomever the account holder. The account balance at that time was {$4000.00} dollars. The high credit and original loan amount of whoever 's account this is was {$9000.00}. This is the posted unanimous information being reported amongst all three major credit bureaus. Can you please advise how with an original balance of {$9000.00} would have a past due balance with a posted unanimous payment of {$13000.00} amongst all three bureaus in addition to a perfect payment history? Further, XXXX and XXXX reflect late payments after the account should have been zero 'd out. It also appears possibly XXXX and XXXX XXXX reflect payments as well. The difference of {$4000.00} and a {$13000.00} payment is positive and should not reflect late payments to whomever the account holder is. I feel the payment history should be thoroughly reviewed. 

Companies that provide information to consumer reporting agencies also have specific legal obligations, including the duty to investigate disputed information. I have been denied this right. Anyone actually looking over the information would notice none of the numbers make any sense. Simply asking the company "" oh is that correct '' is not proper due diligence nor an acceptable response. This information can be taken directly off of the credit report without even contacting any company. The account is riddled with inconsistencies and for that fact alone it needs to be removed. This request is further supplemented by the following definitions all of which are met. 

An account whose status is paid in full, and thus has no balance due but nevertheless reflects a balance due ; An account that reflects an Original Loan Amount that increases over time, an impossibility by definition ; Derogatory information being reported on an account, although that derogatory information predates an earlier report that did not include the derogatory information. 

The account is not mine and I do not owe them anything. The account is riddled with illogical reporting. My credit has always been perfect across the board never a single late payment. I notice a false account on my reports and I dispute it and then all of a sudden you want to retaliatorily change loan amounts and past due balances and throw late payments on there. I have copies of all the prior credit reports. There was never a late payment reported or derogatory information in any prior reports until I stated the balance was not mine. The changes to the report were done in malice. My information was also leaked and documentation to support that has also been submitted. I do not know what it is but what I do know is that none of it is correct. 

The bureaus have a duty to report accurate information and the misreporting of such information is misutilization of my information and a violation of the fair credit reporting act. Further, this is a misrepresentation of my character which has done me economic harm and damages and I want the account removed immediately. I would say an additional 17 months now I have been forced to be a renter due to improper credit reporting at a current market rent of {$1200.00}. ( {$21000.00} ). I have other large personal obligations that have either had to close at above market rates or were not able to close. 

Look at my perfect credit history exclusive of that account, over XXXX years of perfect payments. You are denying me the right to seek a home or other credit predicated on comical posted transactional history, illogical reporting, and retaliatory practices. I would venture to say the aforementioned may possibly constitute negligent noncompliance with the fair credit reporting act.

So received no bills, plus returned item never credited. 
Neighbor told me woman in neighborhood was collecting my mail and packages from old address? 
I called XXXX and tried to figure out how to fix my account. But was told rudely that my file was sold? 
Ultities we're opened or reopened in my name on XXXX XXXX. After I moved XX/XX/XXXX? XXXX was one they say I owe 1200+ yet I returned equipment 2 months after I moved. I had boxed equipment in basement. 
even have confirmation email from XXXX for pickup. 
I soon found out my credit card was hacked. 
Bank closed and new one opened. My XXXX account with store hacked with all finicial & personal info on sites, I filed police report, identify thief. Org report, FBI report, this hacker from same state was blackmailing me for XXXX! 
I explained all this to companies and credit reports, they removed some items, but some that I disputed they came back that it remains. The collector assures it's info is correct? 
I am greatly upset about this. Especially XXXX XXXX XXXX, a online loan that I paid more than I should of. They were very deceptive about their fees and what was a payday installment loan that I paid over 1500 on and still owed more than original XXXX. 
But anyway I took it out in XX/XX/XXXX they reported it as 1 month loan and updated it, so to have at least a year of no pymt 's on my report? 
I copied and sent print out of all monthly pymt 's and screen shots of email confirming loan was indeed a installment loan. Yet none of the credit reporting co. Would agree, and when I disputed there findings and asked to see companies proof they didn't respond. 
I told them also I was victim of identity thief, because alot of credit inquiries kept coming up on report. I wanted fraud put on reports so I could explain If I did apply for credit that someone was pretending to be me, XXXX and purposely putting gas on in where I lived at time my info was stolen. 
What makes me the most made is these reports are not fair or honest.experian. I signed up for protection XXXX after I did 2 big items disappeared. XXXX XXXX XXXX being one. 
Yet after 3 months when I cancelled the program. They were back on my report!! 
This is abuse of power! 
I had gotten 2 reports XXXX & Experian back up a little to around 580, but XXXX was XXXX. Yesterday I went on and it was down XXXX points? I inquired why? And a nice representative Said 'oh It just happens some times? 
I pointed out nothing was changed at all. And updated her on my filed police report reporting the identity thief and fraud.She didn't even want the report # or a copy.yet they would not put fraud on my report unless I filed one? 
It really bothers me that if I was willing to pay each company for Monitoring protection XXXX Things would vanish off my report? 
Also they do investigations Yet show no proof collector showed, yet share my information with companies? Which I know for fact one company updated dates to match my information, instead of original reported dates that collector posted which had me living in another home at the time ultility provider stated I used them? The whole process especially with identify thief is hard enough, without companies that are supposed to be trustful and impartial showing it's just the opposite. 
Honestly Now I have to wonder if they get kick back from collection companies??? 
They need monitoring. 
Along with these collectors that change bc dates to suit thier claims. 
And on a final note. My reports still aren't marked from for fraud? they have identify thief report and police report information. 
And on final note to I sent them copies of threatening lawyers emails from XXXX XXXX, threatening me with jail, fraud, to contact my probation officer if I have one etc.

Very classless, when I read the rules for collections on FCRA site.I saw this was illegal? Yet my credit report disputed monitor didn't find it so? They had copies of letters from my dispute.yet neither company said by the way XXXX, letters like this are illegal. Please look into it on identify thief site for further information. 
Yet then I wasn't paying XXXX or Experian monthly payments anymore. 
I also think it's against our civil rights if we want them to add rent, phone payments to reports to increase our scores. We have to give them our email and password for online banking, so they can verify each month instead of a yearly print out from my bank? 
I DON'T think so???

They reported that I did not qualify for the lowest interest, and stated it was based on my credit score and credit report. 

In the body of the letter I received it stated that under federal law, you have the right to obtain a copy of your credit report without charge for 60 days after you receive this notice. To obtain your free report, contact : Equifax Credit Information Services , Inc., XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX, XXXX http : //www.equifax.com. 

I then called the phone number to request a copy of my free report. I spoke to XXXX, and was then asked a lot of questions : my full name, my ss #, my address, my home mortgage holder and amount of my mortgage, my car loan provider and the amount I pay, my other credit card cards. 

At this time I felt I was providing information to a scammer to use against me to get my identify for fraud. 

I then asked to speak to her supervisor. After a lengthy wait I spoke to Supervisor with first name as XXXX. She said that they have to ask me these questions to ascertain whether I am the rightful holder of the credit information. I asked them how may ways do I have to confirm who I am am. Send me my report and I will report any reporting errors. I then stated that I feel this is unreasonable and unnecessary since I do not think that you asked XXXX XXXX for all this information about me BUT you sent them a report on me. 

When I asked where the supervisor where she was located, she announced the XXXX. When I told her that this smacks as your company trying to get my information to steal my identify and that I do not feel secure answering anymore questions. 

I then asked for her supervisor and she said that her supervisor would tell me the same thing. 

I then told her I would report this company to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the Consumer Finance Agency. 

I then stated I would like her to hang up so that I can take the survey they asked me to take at the beginning of the call to tell them about my experience and to tell them how dissatisfied I was. She then wished me a good day and hung up. Then a voice next came on the call said to take the survey, press 1, which I did the connection was severed. 

I believe this company and its operation is fraudulent and as I see from many other same complaints, it should be investigated for misuse of information, not providing what they profess to provide and action taken against them to rescind their license to be credit reporting agency and the public be informed that it is not an authorized credit reporting agency. 

I also request that an investigation be made into their call collection information such as the one I experienced and whether it leads to identify theft. 

I will be following up with my congressman on this complaint.",None,"EQUIFAX, INC.",RI,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/05/19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3233145

When I try to drill down into the account on my Experian creditworks there is no account there. I think that some of the blocked information is still effecting some versions of my FICO score.

Can someone please look into this because if a lender pulls fico 8 from Experian it is only XXXX when my Experian Fico 2 and bankcard 8 are above 750.

01/30/21,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"This past Fall I refinanced my VA Mortgage that has been held with Quicken Loans. I reached out to Quicken in XXXX to inquire about VA IRRL options but settled on XXXX due to more competitive rates. I began receiving calls multiple times a week from Quicken in XXXX to try and get me to refinance with them as well. As those calls and voicemails continued through XXXX and XXXX I received two voicemails that my account was passed due. I contacted Quicken and was directed to the refinance team, who again was trying to sell me on a Quicken refinance and told me my loan was in good standing. I continued my refinance with XXXX XXXX and was scheduled to close in XXXX, but was delayed three times all the way to XX/XX/2020, due to XXXX XXXX being behind on closings. I continued to pay my current Quicken mortgage in the process to ensure no payments were missed in the transition. 

I was notified again by voicemail in early XXXX that I had a past due Quicken bill, which surprised me as I had seen my check to Quicken for the month clear. I called them back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that I had {$64.00} past due balance on my over $ XXXX monthly mortgage payment, based on a change to my escrow amount that I was previously unaware of. I sent payment that day which was received and cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. I inquired as to why my escrow payment was increased when I would be getting a check to close that account within a month. They wanted me to send them {$64.00} when they were going to turn around and send me a check for over {$2000.00} within a couple weeks since that account was in the process of being closed and no more payments would be made from it. I was told by the Quicken agent on the XXXX that this would not be reported to the credit agency. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that my credit report showed a late payment to Quicken. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX who said that the escrow was recalculated in XXXX and a notification was sent. He said he could see that notifications were sent again in XXXX but noted that he could see that they were returned. I believe those notices, just like my escrow refund check which was sent to me by Quicken in XXXX, was sent to the wrong address. 

I was in the midst of refinancing and Quicken had already sent out my payoff notification to XXXX XXXX and were actively trying to get me to refinance with them instead. The Quickens sales team and account management teams failed to share information and provided me incorrect information as a customer.

01/30/21,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"This past Fall I refinanced my VA Mortgage that has been held with XXXXXXXX XXXX. I reached out to XXXX in XXXX to inquire about VA IRRL options but settled on XXXX due to more competitive rates. I began receiving calls multiple times a week from XXXX in XXXX to try and get me to refinance with them as well. As those calls and voicemails continued through XXXX and XXXX I received two voicemails that my account was passed due. I contacted XXXX and was directed to the refinance team, who again was trying to sell me on a XXXX refinance and told me my loan was in good standing. I continued my refinance with XXXX XXXX and was scheduled to close in XXXX, but was delayed three times all the way to XX/XX/2020, due to XXXX XXXX being behind on closings. I continued to pay my current XXXXXXXX XXXX in the process to ensure no payments were missed in the transition. 

I was notified again by voicemail in early XXXX that I had a past due XXXX bill, which surprised me as I had seen my check to XXXX  for the month clear. I called them back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that I had {$64.00} past due balance on my over $ XXXX monthly mortgage payment, based on a change to my escrow amount that I was previously unaware of. I sent payment that day which was received and cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. I inquired as to why my escrow payment was increased when I would be getting a check to close that account within a month. They wanted me to send them {$64.00} when they were going to turn around and send me a check for over {$2000.00} within a couple weeks since that account was in the process of being closed and no more payments would be made from it. I was told by the XXXX agent on the XXXX that this would not be reported to the credit agency. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that my credit report showed a late payment to XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX who said that the escrow was recalculated in XXXX and a notification was sent. He said he could see that notifications were sent again in XXXX but noted that he could see that they were returned. I believe those notices, just like my escrow refund check which was sent to me by XXXX in XXXX, was sent to the wrong address. 

I was in the midst of refinancing and XXXX had already sent out my payoff notification to XXXX XXXX and were actively trying to get me to refinance with them instead. The XXXX sales team and account management teams failed to share information and provided me incorrect information as a customer.

I was not informed or included in a legal settlement with CPFB and Nationstar Mortgage, dba Mr. Cooper. I believe that I should have been included in the damages paid for Mr. Cooper 's fraudulent practices because I have been complaining for years about their fraud in my mortgage account. Secondly, I am including documentation that shows Nationstar fabricated my credit report by reporting late payments when I paid on time. The discrepancy in my payment and the mortgage amount is because of Mr. Cooper manipulating my escrow account and changing my mortgage payment frequently without adequate notice starting XX/XX/XXXX and continued unit XXXX. I have never been 30, 60, or 90 days late for any mortgage payment. Nationstar has a routine practice of changing escrow with less than 30 days notice then holding timely payments in a separate suspense account and not giving credit for the payments made on time. The amount of the differences were less than {$100.00}. Nationstar routinely made adjustments then penalized mortgagees and damaged my credit for no reason other than manipulation of my account. The statements that I am providing were created more recently and were never provided to me at the time of the alleged late payments. The statements show payments being received by Nationstar when they were reporting my payments late but in fact where deposited into a suspense account. This should have been part of the litigation settlement which I should have been a part of. I did request a forbearance which I received because I temporarily lost my job during the Great Recession. The problem I have is that Nationstar has refused to remove the negative credit report because of their malfeasance in manipulation of escrow. Regular and frequent escrow calculations are not the norm in any other mortgage servicer and XXXX did so out of fraud. I have attempted to get clarification from Nationstar but they have never provided a full accounting for why the escrow frequently changed from month to month from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX.

07/31/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I was contacted earlier this year by a person claiming to represent Hyundai stating that I had a past due balance on my account. At that time, I was unaware of any balance due, and had already turned in this leased vehicle to the dealership months earlier, in favor of a renewed lease on a newer vehicle. While speaking to the agent on the phone, I logged into my account at hmfusa.com, and saw that I have a {$0.00} balance. My most recent statement for this account was dated XX/XX/2019 and showed Total Amount Due {$0.00}. 
Considering I had an unknown person calling me unsolicited and asking for money, while giving me conflicting information from what my online statement showed me, obviously this raised red flags. The agent was unable to tell me why my online account showed no balance due, or what the amount owed was for. The agent advised they would mail me an invoice showing me the balance due, which I agreed to review and pay if it was in fact legitimate. 
This invoice never arrived. I have still yet to receive any piece of paper showing what the balance owed is for. 
Moving forward, I have been in the process of refinancing my home. Earlier this month, my mortgage broker advised me that they noticed a sharp drop in my credit score from one day to the next. I immediately reviewed my credit report to find that Hyundai reported my account as seriously delinquent, for a vehicle I had turned in more than six months ago, and for an account to which I have no statement showing I owe any money. To add to this, my account was enrolled in autopay, which served to pay any balance for the duration of my lease. Any money owed should have just been debited from my account, but that is not what happened. 
I have since attempted to resolve this matter with Hyundai Motor Finance over the phone over multiple occasions. I was transferred, hung up on, and lied to. I was told I would receive a call back from a manager within 72 hours, only to find out a week later that no managers make outbound calls, and that there was no record of that request on my account. 
I have since paid the balance due, despite still not seeing any invoice to indicate what it was for, as my concern for the $ XXXX dollars that I was told I owed is far less than the impact this has taken on my credit report. I have worked very diligently throughout my life to maintain a flawless credit score, however this incident has taken me from over 800, to in the 600s at the time of this writing. I am in the process of trying to refinance my home, and this incident is severely impacting my ability to do so, and in turn costing me FAR more money than the {$300.00} Hyundai requested ( and in turn received ) from me.

I have now sent a letter in writing to Hyundai, as I was told this is the only method I am able to communicate with their disputes department. I initiated a dispute with XXXX when this first appeared ealier this month, however just today this has now appeared on my XXXX   report as well, despite having already been paid!

07/31/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I was contacted earlier this year by a person claiming to represent XXXX stating that I had a past due balance on my account. At that time, I was unaware of any balance due, and had already turned in this leased vehicle to the dealership months earlier, in favor of a renewed lease on a newer vehicle. While speaking to the agent on the phone, I logged into my account at XXXX, and saw that I have a {$0.00} balance. My most recent statement for this account was dated XX/XX/2019 and showed Total Amount Due {$0.00}. 
Considering I had an unknown person calling me unsolicited and asking for money, while giving me conflicting information from what my online statement showed me, obviously this raised red flags. The agent was unable to tell me why my online account showed no balance due, or what the amount owed was for. The agent advised they would mail me an invoice showing me the balance due, which I agreed to review and pay if it was in fact legitimate. 
This invoice never arrived. I have still yet to receive any piece of paper showing what the balance owed is for. 
Moving forward, I have been in the process of refinancing my home. Earlier this month, my mortgage broker advised me that they noticed a sharp drop in my credit score from one day to the next. I immediately reviewed my credit report to find that XXXX reported my account as seriously delinquent, for a vehicle I had turned in more than six months ago, and for an account to which I have no statement showing I owe any money. To add to this, my account was enrolled in autopay, which served to pay any balance for the duration of my lease. Any money owed should have just been debited from my account, but that is not what happened. 
I have since attempted to resolve this matter with XXXX XXXX XXXX over the phone over multiple occasions. I was transferred, hung up on, and lied to. I was told I would receive a call back from a manager within 72 hours, only to find out a week later that no managers make outbound calls, and that there was no record of that request on my account. 
I have since paid the balance due, despite still not seeing any invoice to indicate what it was for, as my concern for the $ 300+ dollars that I was told I owed is far less than the impact this has taken on my credit report. I have worked very diligently throughout my life to maintain a flawless credit score, however this incident has taken me from over 800, to in the 600s at the time of this writing. I am in the process of trying to refinance my home, and this incident is severely impacting my ability to do so, and in turn costing me FAR more money than the {$300.00} XXXX requested ( and in turn received ) from me. 
I have now sent a letter in writing to XXXX, as I was told this is the only method I am able to communicate with their disputes department. I initiated a dispute with XXXX when this first appeared ealier this month, however just today this has now appeared on my Experian report as well, despite having already been paid!

01/30/21,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"This past Fall I refinanced my VA Mortgage that has been held with XXXX Loans. I reached out to XXXX in XXXX to inquire about VA IRRL options but settled on XXXX due to more competitive rates. I began receiving calls multiple times a week from XXXX in XXXX to try and get me to refinance with them as well. As those calls and voicemails continued through XXXX and XXXX I received two voicemails that my account was passed due. I contacted XXXX and was directed to the refinance team, who again was trying to sell me on a XXXX refinance and told me my loan was in good standing. I continued my refinance with XXXX XXXX and was scheduled to close in XXXX, but was delayed three times all the way to XX/XX/2020, due to XXXX XXXX being behind on closings. I continued to pay my current XXXX XXXX in the process to ensure no payments were missed in the transition. 

I was notified again by voicemail in early XXXX that I had a past due XXXX bill, which surprised me as I had seen my check to XXXX  for the month clear. I called them back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that I had {$64.00} past due balance on my over $ XXXX  monthly mortgage payment, based on a change to my escrow amount that I was previously unaware of. I sent payment that day which was received and cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. I inquired as to why my escrow payment was increased when I would be getting a check to close that account within a month. They wanted me to send them {$64.00} when they were going to turn around and send me a check for over {$2000.00} within a couple weeks since that account was in the process of being closed and no more payments would be made from it. I was told by the XXXX agent on the XXXX that this would not be reported to the credit agency. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that my credit report showed a late payment to XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX who said that the escrow was recalculated in XXXX and a notification was sent. He said he could see that notifications were sent again in XXXX but noted that he could see that they were returned. I believe those notices, just like my escrow refund check which was sent to me by XXXX in XXXX, was sent to the wrong address. 

I was in the midst of refinancing and XXXX had already sent out my payoff notification to XXXX XXXX and were actively trying to get me to refinance with them instead. The XXXX sales team and account management teams failed to share information and provided me incorrect information as a customer. They admitted to sending information about changes to my account to the wrong address. They should have halted any changes to the account once it was in progress of being sold. They reported a late payment to the credit reporting agencies, after saying they would not due so due to the confusion and are inaccurately reporting a late payment. My payment was never late, it was short by 1 %, {$32.00} on an over {$3200.00} payment and even then, the principal and interest were more than covered and my escrow balance had more than enough balance to cover all payments through the remainder of the loan. So much so, that I received over {$2000.00} back from XXXX to close that escrow account in less than a month.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,RI,028XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,01/30/21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4105078

That day when I was added XXXX account was already negative, I said this seems like a bad idea I don't want to go on this account as a signer when it is negative. He said a customer had written him a check and it will be handled. I believed him. 

Now fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX I have never written any checks out of that account nor did I ever have a debit card with my name on it. My issue is this was his account it is negative because of his negligence not mine. I had a XXXX XXXX XXXX  account for 19 years which now is closed and purged because XXXX XXXX wrote and deposited checks into my account and they were bogus.

I had, in fact, recently paid my XXXX XXXX Card off entirely then began to use it again. I made all payments ON TIME and only used approximately {$380.00} of my credit line. I did not ask for an increase. XXXX XXXX informed me that they ran a recent review of my account, without my permission. Due to the response from Transunion Consumer Relations ( www.Transunion.com/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/ XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, PA XXXX XXXX-XXXX-XXXX ), they were given the following inaccurate and untrue reasons for their decision : 1. Serious Delinquency 2. Proportion of Balances to Credit Limits on Bank/National Revolving or Other Revolving Accounts is too high 3. Too few accounts currently paid as agreed 4. Proportion of Loan Balances to Loan Amounts is too High 5.  Number of Inquiries was a Factor in Determining Score As a result, my FICO score dropped from a XXXX to a XXXX. 

In XX/XX/2019, I was granted a Home Equity Line of Credit of {$50000.00} from XXXX XXXX. Most of this money was used to pay off credit cards and an installment loan. As a result, I have not applied for any new credit since obtaining this HELOC and should have no new inquiries on my report other than XXXX, themselves. I paid off the installment loan, as well as many of the credit cards, with the exception of two. The ones I did not pay off, have been part of a Credit Management Program for two years and have been paid consistently on time. The information Transunion gave to XXXX XXXX  is false and misleading and I want it corrected immediately. The only change to my credit report has been for the better and I have no idea where they are coming up with this information.

For all practical purposes, the commission is a front that allows lenders to do as they see fit regardless of the law.

If a consumer complains to the Bank Commissioner about a lending agency, the case is immediately closed out, once the lending agency responds in writing to the CFPB. This policy does not allow the consumer to rebuttal. This consumer protection policy is "" no policy at all '' and is pro lender.

Lending agencies such as Capitol One, know this and hand out gibberish response to complaints that defy logic and they are never examined by The Commission.

I complained and without any change in my credit Experian has lowered my credit score two months in a row even as their information about my lower no debt levels have been used to justify lowering my credit score. 

The reason given in my credit score is "" credit utilization ''. Basically, I had credit cards but no longer use them. I have a HELOC but the balance is going down. When my Refi kicks in and my HELOC is paid off I assume that Experian will decide that my credit score and credit utilization will result in credit dropping to XXXX??????

We would like the ability to purchase our home but, when dealing with an organization whose business model is based upon data accuracy - and the absolute protection of that data - we can not move forward with a loan because a company has poor business practices.

( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

09/28/17,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"I have initiated an investigation into a fraudulent student loan taken out under my name and have given Sallie Mae/XXXX enough information as well as new information to come to the obvious conclusion that this loan was taken out without my knowledge or consent ; that the body of the loan belonged to my late father XXXX XXXX. I did defer the loan more than once and contacted an attorney to devise a course of action. A letter was sent by XXXX XXXX XXXX who is a Elder Law/Estate Attorney in RI and has worked on my late father 's estate and under the advice of the Executor XXXX XXXX XXXX that this loan was taken out without my knowledge. In good faith, I did pay some of the loan because I was advised by said attorney to do so. XXXX XXXX ONLY wrote XXXX letter and made XXXX phone call to the XXXX XXXX XXXX office, in which they told him that because the name matches the borrower, then the loan belonged to me. XXXX XXXX has been released. My mother XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I called the Sallie Mae office. The representatives stated that they could no longer speak to me because I had representation and gave me a phone number for said attorney that does n't exist. ( XXXX ) I filed a complaint with the FTC, the Department of Education and the XXXX Police because my Identity was stolen by my father and documents were falsified to obtain money to pay for my education. Furthermore, I have also been referenced as a mortgage holder by the Law Firm XXXX XXXX XXXX now know as XXXX XXXX XXXX being addressed to The Spouse of XXXX XXXX ''. This letter was in reference to the foreclosure of the property XXXX my former home ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX RI, which I have no legal link. However, I was referenced on the Sallie Mae loan as being married under my information and that any additional income was from my spouse. I am not married and never have been married. The additional income is in reference to my late fathers wife XXXX XXXX XXXX and again, she is also the Executor of his estate. There is no other link to my being referenced as "" married '' but in the body of the Sallie Mae/Navient loan. 

Pay stubs have been submitted showing and will prove that I never worked at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, and never made {$100000.00}. In addition I will enclosed proof that my late father worked for XXXX XXXX and never worked for a company listed as XXXX XXXX. My father referenced myself as being married and not he. Also enclosed was a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX my XXXX XXXX which states that she also never knew about this loan and was listed in the loan as a reference. 

I was informed from a Sallie MaeXXXX XXXX representative, XXXX XXXX that the burden of proof that I didnt know was on me. However, considering that this document was obviously falsified ( which is a crime ) and that Sallie MaeXXXX approved a loan that was obviously false leads me to believe that the burden falls on Sallie MaeXXXX to prove that I did know about where the funds for my education came from. That Sallie Mae/XXXX approved on their own an obvious illegal document. My late father XXXX XXXX took care of the finances and so did his wife XXXX XXXX XXXX because she co-signed a loan from XXXX XXXX. I was told before my father passed that I was responsible for ONLY the payment on the last semester of my time at XXXX XXXX and XXXX other loan which XXXX XXXX co signed and I have done so. 

Based on my investigation, I have advised Sallie MaeXXXX that this loan was applied for by my late father, XXXX XXXX XXXX and because of Sallie MaeXXXX XXXX XXXX rules he put me down as the borrower, there was no other option. This loan was obviously his. At this point in time, Sallie MaeXXXX has failed to filed a claim against my late father 's estate ( which is still open ), they also insisted after the XXXX day time frame ( when we called again ) that a letter was sent to the XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX of RI regarding the response to our opposition. In the body of the original document sent, we stated that the attorney was released. I have yet to get a confirmation that that was the case because the attorney refuses to acknowledge that he received the letter. 

My XXXX XXXX has been adversely effected after I spoke to the Sallie Mae/XXXX representatives and I was told that a freeze was to occur until the investigation was concluded. They keep emailing me stating that I 'm missing payments. All three credit bureau have been notified of the situation ( and will be notified again XXXX. Sallie Mae received an email from XXXX or more reporting agencies that the stated loan is not mine. As I have stated before, I have sent Sallie Mae/XXXX additional documents to prove this to be the case. 

In conclusion, I need Sallie Mae to admit negligence, that they approved a fraudulent and illegal document willingly, that they reverse any disparing marks on my credit reports, that they acknowledge that although the money went to my education, the true owner was my late father ( he insisted that I be kept out of the details of my education 's funding ) and because he passed, it should be forgiven. I am also insisting that monies sent to Sallie Mae/XXXX be refunded and that they file for damages against the estate of XXXX XXXX through the XXXX.

XXXX advised that we were still within our 12 months of forbearance and that our payments were not required for XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX. She sent me an email that day detailing some programs that may become available should we still need assistance after XXXX, and we said that we would speak again in early XXXX to discuss further. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received notifications from the 3 credit reporting agencies that I had a 30-day late payment for my mortgage through RI Housing XXXX I immediately called XXXX and asked if this was an error and offered to provide the XXXX payment instead of continuing with the forbearance as I had no negative information on my credit up until this point. XXXX advised this was not necessary and that the credit reporting would be corrected but that they were not showing any inaccuracies on their end. 

I followed up again on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX with "" proof '' of this reporting coming from all of the credit bureaus including screen shots. I had started to receive certified letters from RIH stating that I was at risk of foreclosure, but then upon speaking with supervisor, XXXX XXXX, and Manager Loan Servicing Risk Representative, XXXX XXXX, I was assured that either my account was reported correctly ( in good standing ) or that I would need to wait several weeks for this to appear on my reporting but not to worry as I was in no way at risk of foreclosure. 

I again followed up with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to check in and advise that my credit had continued to plummet as I now show as 60 days late. Several of my credit cards had seen this inaccurate information and began to lower my credit allowances which again continued to drop my scores. XXXX responded with "" We have corrected the late payment reporting for XX/XX/XXXX as current. Typically, the credit bureaus take 30-60 days ( sometimes sooner ) to update corrections submitted. '' My credit continued to crumble throughout the weeks and thus I followed up with XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX to ask if there was anything else at all that could be done in the meantime. I advised that I had disputed these inaccuracies 3x directly through the credit bureaus and that they were coming back as "" declined, information verified as correct. '' XXXX stated that a third-party vendor handled any disputes but that she would look into this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I engaged XXXX XXXX for assistance with this matter. Within hours I began receiving alerts that the late payments had been removed and my score started to recover, ( although this will have no impact on the creditors that have lowered limits causing my usage to skyrocket ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX received a call from a representative at RIH who advised that our account needed an additional {$500.00} to be brought current. I inquired how this was possible given that we made an "" extra '' payment in XXXX of {$1100.00} ( this was not required ), and our XXXX payment was made in full and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. I began to explain all of the trouble we had with this in the past and offered to make the payment if necessary to avoid any additional credit related issues, but the representative refused and said they would need to look into this and "" call me right back. '' I did not receive a call back and on XX/XX/XXXX I received notification from multiple credit bureaus that my account is now 60-90 days delinquent. This is all but impossible given that I have only truly "" missed '' XXXX and XXXX when we were in a protected forbearance. I called and left XXXX XXXX another voicemail and I also sent a detailed email.

03/30/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"This complaint is against our mortgage lender, XXXX XXXX XXXX for refusing to report payments accurately to credit bureaus. We filed Chapter XXXX Personal Bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. We were 2-3 monthly payments behind on our mortgage ( established XX/XX/XXXX ), which our lawyer said could be included in the bankruptcy, so we could start with clean slate on our mortage the following month. We began immediately getting calls and mail about foreclosure due to delinquency from XXXX XXXX We worked that year to pay in full the additional three payments that were behind ( and majority of late payments ), while also paying our regular monthly amounts ( {$1100.00} ). We have additional loan of {$34.00} per month with XXXX XXXX for initial down payment amount that we have paid as well. Since that time, we have kept current with our mortgage payments ( 6.5 total years of making payments ).

We requested our three credit reports last year after being initially denied a used car loan. We discovered that on two of the major bureau reports ( Equifax and XXXX  ), our mortgage is listed as discharged under the XXXX Bankruptcy and closed with no further payments made. The third one does list payments being made. 
I initiated an investigation with both bureaus to check with XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify the account status is still open, current and payments have been made since XXXX XXXX bankruptcy filing. Both bureaus reported back that XXXX XXXX  did not verify payments and stated that the credit reports are accurate as they stand. 
I then called XXXX XXXX and talked to a gentleman who stated that since our attorney did not file a mortgage affirmation document, they do not have to report payments, as it is considered a bankruptcy. I asked him then if that meant that we did not have to make payments all these years as we have done. He told me that of course we had to make payments, or they would foreclose on us. I later wrote to XXXX XXXX to ask what we needed to do to reaffirm our mortgage, if there was a form that we needed to provide. I was told to talk to a lawyer. 
After doing research and seeking legal advice, I found that a loan affirmation isn't possible so many years after bankruptcy, and that it is not recommended. I also found that it is against the Federal Fair  Credit Reporting Act for a business or lender to withhold information or not accurately report if you are making payments. We have made every single required payment on our mortgage now for almost seven ( 7 ) years. While our personal bankruptcy did negatively impact our credit score and report, we feel that the current status of showing that our entire mortgage debt was discharged and now closed with no further payments has a huge impact on our credit rating. A mortgage is usually the highest monthly payments people make in their lifetime, and we would like credit for making these payments and keeping current with our mortgage. We feel that by refusing to accurately report our payments, XXXX XXXX XXXX is not adhering to fair credit reporting practices. We have tried to rectify this situation on our own by contacting the credit reporting bureaus, XXXX XXXX XXXX several times, and by seeking legal advice. We are asking for assistance in having XXXX XXXX  accurately report our payments.",None,"EQUIFAX, INC.",RI,028XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/30/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3196552

Going forward equifax should be required to monitor every account and notify victims if any fraud occurs. Credit fraud protection should be mandatory for every account, not an option for us to have deal with. 

This should be rectified firstly by making credit freezing free and refunding everyone who paid for it following this data breach.

03/30/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"This complaint is against our mortgage lender, Rhode Island Housing for refusing to report payments accurately to credit bureaus. We filed Chapter XXXX Personal Bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. We were 2-3 monthly payments behind on our mortgage ( established XX/XX/XXXX ), which our lawyer said could be included in the bankruptcy, so we could start with clean slate on our mortage the following month. We began immediately getting calls and mail about foreclosure due to delinquency from RI Housing. We worked that year to pay in full the additional three payments that were behind ( and majority of late payments ), while also paying our regular monthly amounts ( {$1100.00} ). We have additional loan of {$34.00} per month with RI Housing for initial down payment amount that we have paid as well. Since that time, we have kept current with our mortgage payments ( 6.5 total years of making payments ). 
We requested our three credit reports last year after being initially denied a used car loan. We discovered that on two of the major bureau reports ( XXXX and XXXX ), our mortgage is listed as discharged under the XXXX Bankruptcy and closed with no further payments made. The third one does list payments being made. 
I initiated an investigation with both bureaus to check with Rhode Island Housing to verify the account status is still open, current and payments have been made since XXXX XXXX bankruptcy filing. Both bureaus reported back that RI Housing did not verify payments and stated that the credit reports are accurate as they stand. 
I then called RI Housing and talked to a gentleman who stated that since our attorney did not file a mortgage affirmation document, they do not have to report payments, as it is considered a bankruptcy. I asked him then if that meant that we did not have to make payments all these years as we have done. He told me that of course we had to make payments, or they would foreclose on us. I later wrote to RI Housing to ask what we needed to do to reaffirm our mortgage, if there was a form that we needed to provide. I was told to talk to a lawyer. 
After doing research and seeking legal advice, I found that a loan affirmation isn't possible so many years after bankruptcy, and that it is not recommended. I also found that it is against the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act for a business or lender to withhold information or not accurately report if you are making payments. We have made every single required payment on our mortgage now for almost seven ( 7 ) years. While our personal bankruptcy did negatively impact our credit score and report, we feel that the current status of showing that our entire mortgage debt was discharged and now closed with no further payments has a huge impact on our credit rating. A mortgage is usually the highest monthly payments people make in their lifetime, and we would like credit for making these payments and keeping current with our mortgage. We feel that by refusing to accurately report our payments, Rhode Island Mortgage is not adhering to fair credit reporting practices. We have tried to rectify this situation on our own by contacting the credit reporting bureaus, Rhode Island Housing several times, and by seeking legal advice. We are asking for assistance in having RI Housing accurately report our payments.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corporation,RI,028XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/30/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3196544

I got preapproved and put an offer on a house. Once the offer was accepted, I went back to the bank to continue the process and submit my application. The bank was able to pull my credit report for XXXX and XXXX but for some reason could not pull it for Equifax. They tried for multiple days before asking me to call Equifax and find out what why it could not be pulled. I spoke to three different customer service representatives, the first checked to make sure there was not a freeze on my account- there was not. She said the bank should be able to pull my report so I told the bank and they tried again, and again they could not pull the report. I called back and was told yet again they could not figure out why the bank could not pull my report. The customer service representative told me to create an account through myequifax.com in order to view my report myself. I tried to create an account and it brought up an error message and told me to call equifax, which I did. They could not tell me why I could not create an account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I figured it out on my own that if I created an account using my maiden name and not my married name that it allowed me to log on and view my report. I called Equifax and explained this. They FINALLY realized that they still had my in their system under my maiden name ( got married 2 1/2 years ago ) and my old address ( from 6 years ago ). They told me to fax over information to them in order for them to update it, and that i would take 5-7 business days. On XX/XX/XXXX I faxed over the information. I informed the bank that this was why it could not be pulled. The mortgage lender said she tried to pull my credit report using just my maiden name to see if that would work and it still would not pull a report. I went on XXXX and tried to order a credit report through equifax and was given a message that I could not order online through them, so I called. I am still waiting for that report to be mailed to me. We're also now on day 9 and the customer service representative I spoke to this morning said they had no received my fax with the information ... well he said, they either did not receive it OR they received it and have not updated it yet. He told me to fax it again. This has been going on for over a month now and the bank is waiting to approve my loan all because of this one credit report that I somehow can not receive.

There is no other link to my being referenced as "" married '' but in the body of the XXXX XXXX loan. 

Pay stubs have been submitted showing and will prove that I never worked at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, and never made {$100000.00}. In addition I will enclosed proof that my late father worked for XXXX XXXX and never worked for a company listed as XXXX XXXX. My father referenced myself as being married and not he. Also enclosed was a letter from XXXX XXXX ( my Aunt ) which states that she also never knew about this loan and was listed in the loan as a reference. 

I was informed from a XXXX XXXX XXXX representative, XXXX , that the burden of proof that I didnt know was on me. However, considering that this document was obviously falsified ( which is a crime ) and that XXXX XXXX approved a loan that was obviously false leads me to believe that the burden falls on XXXX XXXX to prove that I did know about where the funds for my education came from. That XXXX XXXX approved on their own an obvious illegal document. My late father XXXX XXXX took care of the finances and so did his wife XXXX XXXX XXXX because she co-signed a loan from XXXX XXXX. I was told before my father XXXX  that I was responsible for ONLY the payment on the last semester of my time at XXXX College and one other loan which XXXX XXXX co signed and I have done so. 

Based on my investigation, I have advised XXXX XXXX that this loan was applied for by my late father, XXXX XXXX XXXX and because of XXXX XXXX XXXX 's rules he put me down as the borrower, there was no other option. This loan was obviously his. At this point in time, XXXX XXXX has failed to filed a claim against my late father 's estate ( which is still open ), they also insisted after the thirty day time frame ( when we called again ) that a letter was sent to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX of RI regarding the response to our opposition. In the body of the original document sent, we stated that the attorney was released. I have yet to get a confirmation that that was the case because the attorney refuses to acknowledge that he received the letter. 

My credit score has been adversely effected after I spoke to the XXXX XXXX representatives and I was told that a freeze was to occur until the investigation was concluded. They keep emailing me stating that I 'm missing payments. All three credit bureau have been notified of the situation ( and will be notified again ). XXXX XXXX received an email from one or more reporting agencies that the stated loan is not mine. As I have stated before, I have sent XXXX XXXX additional documents to prove this to be the case. 

In conclusion, I need XXXX XXXX to admit negligence, that they approved a fraudulent and illegal document willingly, that they reverse any disparing marks on my credit reports, that they acknowledge that although the money went to my education, the true owner was my late father ( he insisted that I be kept out of the details of my education 's funding ) and because he XXXX, it should be forgiven. I am also insisting that monies sent to XXXX XXXX be refunded and that they file for damages against the estate of XXXX XXXX through the Executor. I can not be held accountable for the actions of my XXXX father.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",RI,02860,None,Consent provided,Web,09/28/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2687135

We are under contract on another house and will lose this one as well if this does n't get resolved. It is important for me to note that Chase reports for the prior month of payment.

We were not under the impression anything would. We found that we were marked late with our car loan through JP Morgan Chase for a month which we were not late. For two months prior we were late due to me being in and out of the hospital, my husband missing work, and unbeknownst to me, you are able to change date of payment with no penalty as long as it falls in the month. I was unaware of this and therefore those months were late. I paid those months ( XXXX and XXXX ) to date in the first week of XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017, amount {$490.00}, once this was paid to date, I then paid for the month of XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017, amount {$240.00}. My payment date is the XXXX of every month so I was sure to pay within the 30 day window. Paying on the XXXX was within that 30 day window. I called and spoke to SEVERAL different people all who told me they could not help me unless they were in the wrong. An investigation was opened with customer support that I called about daily. I was sent to the highest supervisor I could go to who was apologetic for the situation, but told me he could n't give me a letter stating they would remove this from my report, the best he could do was refund all late fees. He told me I had to go through the credit bureaus which I do n't have time to wait on considering the situation. He sent me to the executive office. They opened an investigation after speaking to two different people in this department, one of whom argued with me until she admitted they were at fault and noted my account. After proving my point that for the month of XXXX I was not late and stating several different times to several different people how time sensitive this is and I need a letter stating this will be removed from my credit to move forward with buying the house, I was unsuccessful in dealing with Chase and told I had to dispute this with the credit bureaus because they are n't authorized to send such letters and they could n't guarantee it would be removed through a dispute. I am at risk to lose my deposit, the house, and I ha e two little ones, another on the way, and this has tossed our world upside down. Chase has acted unreasonably in this situation.

then XXXX XXXX shared my info on the credit bureaus. 
All of the credit bureaus show that I am very responsible by my credit scores Also on my credit score, it states that the account with Ally Financial was closed, in XXXX of XXXX when in actual the repoed vehicle was auctioned off for {$9500.00} and they could have auctioned it off for much more. 
Instead they decide to sell it in auction and sell the balance to XXXX XXXX and situations are very suspect. 
I Just received a 1099c from Ally Financial stating that my balance owed is {$1700.00} dollars even though it is stated on my credit score on XXXX XXXX  that the remaining balance is $ XXXX. 
I called and spoke to a rep. name XXXX XXXX and informed her that the balance on the 1099c has the amount of {$1700.00} and asked what amount she seen on the file there. She stated that the amount on file is at {$11000.00}. 
I asked her how can my XXXX XXXX beareau amount state {$11000.00} and her file states the same amount, but I received a different amount on the XXXX form? 
The XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX to me that she doesn't know anything concerning a XXXX being sent to me. 
I believe I am being given untrue info to lure me into paying the untrue balance on the XXXX form, then only {$1700.00}. would be taken off the said balance on the charge off amount, and once I start making a payment I will be liable of the remaining balance. 
I have informed XXXX XXXX that it states on my credit XXXX XXXX XXXX that the account was closed in XXXX of XXXX even tho the vehicle was sold at a auction years earlier. There are XXXX credit bureaus and only credit Karma has the charge off listed on it. 
My rights were violated by XXXX XXXX. Ally Financial has not reported anything and my credit scores are very high and excellent on all 3 bureaus. I feel since there are two amounts stated that I am being lied to along with the credit bureau being lied to. 
Never was I offered to to pay the {$1700.00} and the account balance at XXXX XXXX would be deleted and closed, so I truly know that is leading false info for me the start payments by falsehoods in writing on a misleading 1099c form which the rep. told me she has no knowledge of. 
Since lies are being told on two different sources, that the account should be deleted. 
XXXX XXXX is also sending the balances only to me and on the XXXX XXXX bureau charge off page, it states that the balance is a joint responsibility. My niece XXXX XXXX allowed the vehicle to be repoed and I gave the needed info to collect the vehicle from her job. There was no tracker on the car, and Ally Financial did not have any knowledge of where my niece lived or worked, so I made it possible for the car to be collected back to Ally Financial. 
I have called Ally XXXX XXXX and received no answer. My phone number has been blocked. I called XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX after receiving the 1099c to let him know that the balance amount on XXXX XXXX bureau is the same amount of {$11000.00}, but yet on the 1099c it states only {$1700.00} but received no answer. 
I feel to many lies are being sent to me in writing. but no phone calls are being answer. 
Also why is the 1099c sent from Ally Financial, when it is stated on my XXXX XXXX bureau file that the account was closed in XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX and now I and looking at the amount due and it states XXXX so the amount of going up, supposibile by Ally Financail when my niece stopped paying on XXXX of XXXX and they auctioned off the car soon after. so why was the account closed in XXXX of XXXX and why is the envelope from the 1099c from Ally Financial if it was charged off by XXXX XXXX. Info is on my XXXX XXXX Bureau. but yet my scores are XXXX with XXXX and XXXX with XXXX and it is stating that I am approved of a car loan if wanted.

This creates a snowball effect, as my FICO scores drop to reflect an increase of debt to available credit, even though the amount of my debt has not increased.

The strategy behind this is clear. The lenders want to prevent me from flipping balances from one card over to another, to take advantage of reduced or XXXX percent interest rates. When my promotional rates expire, they go to 30 % or more, and any effort to open a new line of credit reduces my score even more. 
This is dirty business. Ive never been late on anything. I have told these creditors that if my interest rates skyrocket, I wont pay them back at all. They dont care : My FICO scores are already ruined because of this.

I am writing about a student loan that has been paid in full for over 2 years now.

The account status from just Equifax appears as "" Open '' and in "" good standing '', with a balance of {$760.00}.

I have filed 4 disputes, which were quickly returned with the results indicating everything is correct ...

I have provided official loan fulfillment letters from both the college and loan servicer company indicating there is no balance, and it has been closed long ago.

I have spoke with representatives from Equifax on the matter as well, and was told that my dispite will not be personally reviewed.

There MUST be a technical issue, which has caused me to chase my tail for far too long.

I have all the documentation on demand ; i will also attach it.

This creates a snowball effect, as my FICO scores drop to reflect an increase of debt to available credit, even though the amount of my debt has not increased.

The strategy behind this is clear. The lenders want to prevent me from flipping balances from one card over to another, to take advantage of reduced or XXXX percent interest rates. When my promotional rates expire, they go to 30 % or more, and any effort to open a new line of credit reduces my score even more. 
This is dirty business. Ive never been late on anything. I have told these creditors that if my interest rates skyrocket, I wont pay them back at all. They dont care : My FICO scores are already ruined because of this.

Corporate greed and stupidity.

FICO scoring and lending industry abuse of this system DIRECTLY CAUSED the financial crisis of 2008. I lost XXXX homes and life savings because of this. 
See my website, XXXX. 
This business model is applied universally. The people it victimizes are rarely aware of the real reasons behind their credit problems.

FICO scoring is the SOLE PARAMETER by which an applicants credit worthiness can be evaluated or considered. Nobody reads credit reports anymore.

11/24/22,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"To Whom it May Concern, I have already filed a complaint. This is an additional complaint and supplementary information I have noticed. Per the attachment, there was a posted payment of {$13000.00} on XX/XX/2021 by whomever the account holder. The account balance at that time was {$4000.00} dollars. The high credit and original loan amount of whoever 's account this is was {$9000.00}. This is the posted unanimous information being reported amongst all three major credit bureaus. Can you please advise how with an original balance of {$9000.00} would have a past due balance with a posted unanimous payment of {$13000.00} amongst all three bureaus in addition to a perfect payment history? Further, XXXX and XXXX reflect late payments after the account should have been XXXX 'd out. It also appears possibly XXXX and XXXX XXXX reflect payments as well. The difference of {$4000.00} and a {$13000.00} payment is positive and should not reflect late payments to whomever the account holder is. I feel the payment history should be thoroughly reviewed. 

Companies that provide information to consumer reporting agencies also have specific legal obligations, including the duty to investigate disputed information. I have been denied this right. Anyone actually looking over the information would notice none of the numbers make any sense. Simply asking the company "" oh is that correct '' is not proper due diligence nor an acceptable response. This information can be taken directly off of the credit report without even contacting any company. The account is riddled with inconsistencies and for that fact alone it needs to be removed. This request is further supplemented by the following definitions all of which are met. 

An account whose status is paid in full, and thus has no balance due but nevertheless reflects a balance due ; An account that reflects an Original Loan Amount that increases over time, an impossibility by definition ; Derogatory information being reported on an account, although that derogatory information predates an earlier report that did not include the derogatory information. 

The account is not mine and I do not owe them anything. The account is riddled with illogical reporting. My credit has always been perfect across the board never a single late payment. I notice a false account on my reports and I dispute it and then all of a sudden you want to retaliatorily change loan amounts and past due balances and throw late payments on there. I have copies of all the prior credit reports. There was never a late payment reported or derogatory information in any prior reports until I stated the balance was not mine. The changes to the report were done in malice. My information was also leaked and documentation to support that has also been submitted. I do not know what it is but what I do know is that none of it is correct. 

The bureaus have a duty to report accurate information and the misreporting of such information is misutilization of my information and a violation of the fair credit reporting act. Further, this is a misrepresentation of my character which has done me economic harm and damages and I want the account removed immediately. I would say an additional 17 months now I have been forced to be a renter due to improper credit reporting at a current market rent of {$1200.00}. ( {$21000.00} ). I have other large personal obligations that have either had to close at above market rates or were not able to close. 

Look at my perfect credit history exclusive of that account, over ~12 years of perfect payments. You are denying me the right to seek a home or other credit predicated on comical posted transactional history, illogical reporting, and retaliatory practices. I would venture to say the aforementioned may possibly constitute negligent noncompliance with the fair credit reporting act.

In the email received from Experian, they outlined their process for validating disputed items on my credit report. It was stated that Experian may contact the furnisher of information or a vendor that collected the information from a public records source to notify them of the dispute and request verification. I was taken aback by this information as I have never provided any permission or authorization for a third-party vendor or data furnisher to participate in the dispute process on my behalf. I have not granted any signed power of attorney or approval for such involvement. 

I am deeply concerned about how these vendors or data furnishers have included themselves in the dispute process and obtained access to my personal and private financial information without my knowledge or consent. It is alarming that these entities have not reached out to me to request my permission or provided any explanation regarding their involvement. As a consumer, I have the right to know which vendors are included in this process, what information they have accessed, and how they have determined the validity of my dispute claims. 

Furthermore, I would like to understand the nature of the relationship between these vendors and the financial institutions involved. Are the financial institutions providing my personal and private financial information to these vendors without my permission? This raises significant concerns about the potential breach of my privacy and the security of my sensitive information. It also begs the question of whether any unauthorized person could approach these financial institutions, claim association with a third-party organization, and gain access to my personal and private financial information. 

I want to emphasize that I do not grant any permission or consent to any third-party working alongside Experian to participate in the dispute process or obtain my personal and private non-public information. I expect Experian to provide a detailed explanation of their involvement with these vendors, the information shared, and the basis for determining the validity of my dispute claims. 

Additionally, I would like to bring to your attention the concerning conduct of Experian in relation to the mistakes on my credit report. Despite my efforts to rectify the errors and address numerous discrepancies, Experian has not taken appropriate action. I have discovered multiple Social Security numbers and numerous incorrect addresses associated with my credit report. These inaccuracies have had a detrimental impact on my credit score, which I believe to be a form of retaliation for my attempts to rectify the situation. 

I kindly request your intervention and assistance in this matter. I urge the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and all relevant agencies to investigate these concerns promptly. I seek a thorough examination of Experian 's practices, the involvement of third-party vendors, and the unauthorized access to personal financial information. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a swift resolution that safeguards consumer rights and ensures the protection of personal information. Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information or documentation to proceed with the investigation. 

Thank you for your prompt attention.

I called the number associated with the transaction and was advised that on XX/XX/XXXX, I signed up for a 7-day trial credit-monitoring service for {$1.00} which would turn into a recurring {$21.00} monthly charge if I failed to cancel the service before the end of the 7-day trial period. 

I honestly don't remember signing up for this service ; I do, however, remember paying {$1.00} to view my credit score when I requested my credit reports from all three credit agencies ( via XXXX ) at the beginning of the year. Is Experian not required to give me more information surrounding my alleged subscription for this service and the terms I allegedly agreed to? 

I have been charged for this credit-monitoring service for the last five months. During the last five months, I have received zero monthly statements for this bill and zero receipts of payment from Experian. The service representative I spoke to claimed that I should have been aware of these charges because they were showing up in my bank statements. 

Are businesses allowed to pull money, on a recurring basis, from a bank account without notifying the owner of the account? That people are assumed to review their bank account statements is no justification for the business ' failure to provide monthly statements or receipts. XXXX and XXXX are just two of the companies that take recurring payments from my bank account and still have the courtesy of providing me with monthly statements and/or receipts.
