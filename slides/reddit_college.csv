This is my first post on Reddit, so I apologize if my post is clunky or lengthy. I am writing this with a bad headache. I'll try to answer any questions anyone has in the comments when it's gone.

I (19F) am in my second year of community college, but I'm struggling with both my mental health and with my education.  I was strictly expected by my parents to attend college, caved in, and forced myself to go, but I don't believe it's the best choice for me at the moment. 

I'm extremely burnt out and at my lowest; I've contemplated suicide a bit, too. I no longer find joy in the things that usually make me happy, and I'm starting to eat less and less. I completely burnt out few weeks ago, so I'm behind in most of my classes with only a month left. I've reached out to one of my professors before, but I'm afraid of going back and talking to her again. I feel like I've let her down too. I might lose my financial aid, because I'm already in the warning area for not taking enough classes last semester (3 instead of 4).  

Thinking about everything makes me want to throw up. I just can't bring myself to do anything or care as much as I used to anymore. I feel useless and like I've ruined everything for myself and my family.

I'm debating on dropping out and coming back to college when I'm in a better mindset than where I am right now. I want to find a therapist, find a job, and work on my art portfolio. 

The thing that's truly holding me back is how my parents will react to everything (especially what'll happen to my financial aid). I fear both them and disappointing them, but I know I'm genuinely at my limit and that this may be the best option.

2023-11-09,1699501356,Withdraw or Take Pass/NoPass grade for Multivariable Calculus,"I am an international freshman who started college in Fall 23. Transitioning to US college as an international is hitting me so hard (influenced by a family trauma) and so concentration needed for the college  courseload has been messed up.


 Multivariable Calculus, which is the hardest of my all four courses in my first semester, is where I am performing the worst. Predicted overall grade at the end of semester for this course is either B, C plus or C(not even a B plus), although I have one month and can try to improve, I don't think I am getting B plus (I might get B but no gurantee) given the amount of lacking amd my work in other courses. 


Other affected course is College Writing 103, where I am probably getting B, in worse case C plus.


Multivariable Calculus is particularly concerning because it is one of the core courses of Mathematics Major( I am double majoring in CS and Math). My predicted grade for other two courses (one in CS and other in Economics) is A.

Now, I have three options: 

1)Withdrawing from either Multivariable Calculus or the Writing intensive course (preferably Withdrawal from Calculus because it is a major course and good letter grade might be important)and retaking it spring semester or next Fall.

2) Taking Pass/No Pass for both the problematic courses, so I receive credit for both without them negatively affecting my GPA. Problem with this option is I might get B or B minus (best case scenario) but no one can see it and so performance in Multivariable Calculus and Writing course remains unquantifiable. Our college have option of requesting written evaluation from the instructor which might talk about my performance equivalent to B but I am not sure if top graduate school admission will have the interest to see that evaluation beyond the Pass grade.(which is negative because they might assume I got C minus, which also gives Pass, but in reality, I performed B minus or B)

3) Continue with letter grade in the Multivariable Calculus, which negatively affects GPA. B minus is probably below 3.0

Please suggest if there is any other option. Also, as I am particularly concerned about how top,  very competitive graduate schools are gonna see each of the options, please advise the best decision accordingly. 

It is also important how my summer internship for industry or research is going to be affected for each choice

2023-11-08,1699463684,Advice? I am considering dropping out of college.,"So I'd like to be an editor for books and news articles. Or maybe even an social media manager. Just something that has to do with reading and writing. I'm 24 years old and currently in community college for a Liberal Arts degree because they do not offer English specific degrees. I don't know if all community colleges are like that or if it's just the one I'm attending, but it's frustrating how there are degrees focused on math and science but not English. :( My issue is that I am terrible at math; I have struggled with it since third grade and I must start at the bottom of the barrel and work my way up. So I have to take three more math classes after the basic math class that I'm in now to get to the class that actually counts towards graduation. Next, I need to take Intro to Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, and then Math Applications. But I'm not even positive that I will pass basic math. I am doing well so far, thiugh. I am getting extra help and completing all the assignments on time, but I think we have at least one more test before the end of the semester and then the final. I bombed one of the tests and got a D on the first one. I did well on the take-home test but that's only because it was open book and I could use a calculator. I'm just thanking God we get unlimited time on the proctored tests at least. It seems that the tests do not bring down grades all that much at all, but I am worried about the final. And even if I do good in this class, I worry about the three other math classes that I'll need to take and that that those tests will not be so forgiving. I am also just frustrated that I have to take a bunch of math courses when I'm not even going to be doing math on my career path, just because I'm not eligible for applications! I'd be taking more math than English classes at this rate (I passed the two that I needed to do with flying colors) despite my career choice (which I've expressed to advisors that I wanted to do). So I'm thinking would it be better to just drop out and get a certificate in editing rather than taking a bunch of math classes when I could be learning more about grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation? It doesn't even seem like I can do the things I want to do until I aim for a BA. And I've read online that you can just skip an an associates degree and go for a BA. = I am interested in journalism as well, which I think is a huge aspect of getting a BA for writing from what I looked into, so I consider that as a potential career too. But the problem is potential math courses, once again. =.=¨For the certificate, I am considering UC Berkeley Global for online courses. Is it legitimate? What would be the best online courses for learning how to edit pieces of writing? But is that a good path though?

Or maybe just focus on getting a BA? That is, if I can find a university that does not require me to do any math courses. =.=¨ Do those even exist? = Is it possible that the community college can offer me alternatives.

2023-11-08,1699439720,Should I take a gap year or change my course? Or continue?,"Hello, I hope no one recognizes me here. I am new to this app, but this is not a new account.

I am currently in third-year college, taking an Electrical Engineering course. Why did I take this? Because I have no choice. I am afraid of being left behind. I was also not lucky in my choice of courses. And this course was the only program open. I accepted it without thinking of what consequences I would face.

In the first year, I managed to pass it because the subjects were not focused on my course itself yet. Also, it was only online then.

And in the second year of the second sem, the school implemented face-to-face classes. I was not ready. But what else is my choice?
In the middle of the second semester, we joked that we had to change our course because it was difficult and we couldn't do it anymore. To me, I was joking, but I am actually thinking about it.

I didn't transfer until my third year of college. But now, I'm losing hope and want to take a gap year. I am starting to get scared. I know fear is normal to feel throughout college. But that kind of fear, I have no courage to face it.

I have multiple reasons why I did not follow my decision. First is my college friends. They are the reason why I was able to get myself here. I will regret leaving the memories we shared.

Second, I didn't think through my decision properly. Maybe because I didn't have enough time to look for a school. I am also thinking about the tuition fee in case I transfer. We have free tuition, by the way. So when you fail a subject, you will lose it, and you will have to pay for the tuition fee.

And maybe it's my pride that's why I can't transfer? I chose it with my own will. Then my parents almost let the whole world know about the course I took. From neighbors to relatives. What will they think when I stop studying?

When I joked to my parents that I was going to change course, they were surprised and angry. Not too angry. They said I should continue because the year is a waste, and I will graduate in just a few years. I still remember saying to them, ""Well, I can't do it anymore. What can you do about it?"" That is the truth. I cannot take it anymore. I have been pressured around me; Professors, subjects, acquaintances who graduated with honors, and society.

I am afraid of my course.

Also, I was having a bad day. I failed my midterm exam in one subject. I thought I was going to pass it, but I didn't. I got 9 out of 50. I answered everything, but there was something wrong with my solution.

Earlier, before the class started, our Professor explained something about solving and said it was an algorithm. I thought it wasn't me. But when I was thinking about getting the test paper, I got a hunch that Sir might be referring to me. 

It was embarrassing. It's like I'm the lowest of all.

Please, do not hate me. I just want to know your opinion and sincere advice.

I'm a microbio/immuno major but suck at chem and am currently getting beat up in gen chem 1.

I've never done well in any math course I've taken; typically, Cs. High school was a very, very rough experience for me\*, and I'm having various troubles in college as well (roommates mainly). Freshman year I failed the exam my college gives out to check if you're eligible to take calculus, but ""only"" by 1-2 points, so I still managed to slip in and start on calculus right away. I am very unhappy this semester because Calc III is difficult to manage, I have a heavy schedule and I'm not getting the amount of time I need to perform well in the class. 2/3 of my calculus teachers have expressed some concern regarding ability to perform well in the course and I'm very inclined to agree with them. The reason I've kept pushing onward is because I fear being left behind by my peers, I don't want to be left in a class with a worse crowd of people, and because I keep ""technically"" passing my courses. But academic karma has caught up to me at this point. I know I cannot just move on to Differential Equations or Linear Algebra after this and I don't know how to remedy my situation in Calculus III. My professor is avoidant of me in lab and isn't very approachable. I could not attend his office hours at the beginning of the year, and I don't wish to bother him with poor understanding of subject matter.

2023-11-05,1699214774,An art student that thinks more than he works.,"It's as the title says. I've trapped myself in an academic work box that's about to implode in roughly 36 hours. I'm in a higher level art studio class that self-directed and since the beginning it's like my drive to create art is just not there. It comes in brief moments of inspiration but does just as soon as it's born. I've had nearly 4 weeks to get this shit done but I've squandered every minute, hour, day, and (now) week up to where I am now. 

I currently have 2 incomplete 18x24 drawings and 0 completion on any of the 8 or so smaller drawings I implied I'd be bringing for Tuesday's critique. And it's not like I don't know what to do, I planned out at the beginning of my semester what my subjects and pieces would generally focus on. I'm to create drawings from a fictional world I created, semi-abstract pieces made of ink and charcoal, and bugs, marmots, and landscapes. I have all these drawings ideas written out to generally follow since the beginning of the semester and yet I've only completed one.

WTF is wrong with me, why haven't I had the energy to create artwork!? Why can't I muster the will to see just what I can really do!? I want to express myself through my work and yet I'm hesitant, too scared to begin the process. It's such weird and uncomfortable feeling: wanting to create art yet fearing that I'll hate the results. I'm too scared to attempt drawing and it disgusts me. I think of so many great things I want to draw and yet I can't bring myself to start. And now, the end draws closer and I'm as far away from adequate as feasibly possible for my class critique.",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17okexm/an_art_student_that_thinks_more_than_he_works/

2023-11-05,1699200938,College is making me angry at everything,"So, I don't usually post on Reddit, but I wanted to see if anyone was experiencing anything similar to me.  I'm a junior at college up North and about 4 hours away from my hometown (where my boyfriend and best friends are).  Being at school makes me miserable and negative about everything.  I used to have quite a large friend group up here in freshman year, but since I stopped partying and drinking we've parted ways and I've grown to resent the people who I used to hang out with.  I lived with 3 of them last year in an apartment and they were probably some of the worst roommates imaginable.  Since then, I've moved into a new apartment with much more mellow roommates with whom I'm not close, but I enjoy talking to them occasionally.  However, I usually find myself in my room and avoiding all human contact during my free time.  This is what I like while I'm here.  I don't like socializing with the people around me at school because everyone and everything makes me SO angry up here.  I find that I get angry at the littlest things and I have negative thoughts all the time.  When people ask me to hang out or even if someone is just reaching out to talk to me, I get genuinely pissed off.  The thing is that when I go home or when I visit my friends, I don't feel this way.  I'm genuinely happy in my friends' company and I never feel burdened by them calling, texting, or making plans with me.  While I'm up at school, I'm constantly just waiting to go back home which I do about every two weeks to see my boyfriend.  It's just so draining to be so negative all the time.  I'm just scared that because I'm so negative here, it will impact the way I am at home or with my relationships that I truly care about.  I find that sometimes I pick fights with my boyfriend while I'm here, or I'll find myself getting annoyed with him in person when I'm anticipating having to go back to school.  For example, if I'm visiting home for the weekend and it's Saturday night (and I leave Sunday morning), I'll have this underlying dread about having to go back to college the next day and I'll start to lash out at him (I know this is super shitty of me and I'm 100% trying to work on it and be better for him).  It's too late for me to transfer schools and I wouldn't want to do that anyhow.  I know I can stick it out for the next year and a half, but I just want to know if this is something anyone else is dealing with or has dealt with before.  I'm looking for some tips and reassurance about this whole situation.  I know it's common to not necessarily like school, but I just have such a negative mindset and I want to truly change so that I can be a better girlfriend and just a better person while I'm up here.",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17ofaws/college_is_making_me_angry_at_everything/

2023-11-04,1699067853,"I am stuck in between two decisions, whats your opinion?","I am 20 and Im currently trying to decide between two different routes towards my higher education and my career at large. I would like to say that I am in a committed long term relationship and that holds a significant part in my decision, however, weve only been together for four months. Our schools are located 30 minutes away from each other. And both schools tuition/fees are around the same ballpark. I just want to weigh out my options. 
My options are as follows:
Option #1. I could stay the route Im at, I am a sophomore at a four year school getting a bachelors degree in human development and family science. I could continue this track, and once I graduate, I could start looking towards a certificate or license of a concentration. I know off the bat that I would like to work with adults primarily. The cons of this option are that I will stay at a school that I havent made a lot of social connections in, that I would be away from my partner, and the area is very spread out. I would most likely not be able to have an internship or otherwise if I were to stay in the area. Another thing is that I would have to room with a lot of people, (ie: renting a bedroom off campus). Although I am open to that, I dont know how that would go. 
Option #2. I could possibly transfer to my partners university for the upcoming fall semester and live with them. The major I am looking at is a child and family development bachelors. I read that the degree can be a little bit difficult to find a job in, but it can be implemented with some jobs/experience to lessen that difficulty. Most of my credits would transfer seamlessly, I would do the same route as stated previously and get a license or certificate for a concentration after graduation. The school is within walking distance to a lot of opportunities when it comes to internships, as it is more urban. Some cons would include a more expensive rent (only by $50), I would have to switch some of my classes around to satisfy this schools prerequisites, and it would be a bit of a hassle to get all of the transfer stuff figured out. 
Either way, my partner says that they just want me to be happy, and choose the best decision for myself.

I went from having some semblence of my shit together in high, school, graduating with honors in the top 10% of my class, 3.68 GPA, to a sucessful summer job where I felt happy and fulfilled, and now I'm pushing papers and solving textbook problems and taking notes and I hate it. I feel more alone than I ever have been, I lost contact with 2/3 of my friends, I'm still living at home and that's been rough too, everything is just falling apart because I can't get my fucking life back together. I'm miserable in my failing classes because its all theoretical, paper pushing so when I have to study or do homework it feels like I'm accomplishing nothing. I have to see a tangible product to my work to make it worthwhile, I've never been called lazy when I'm actually able to get through my depression, its just having the grit that I suck at. Regardless my parents are paying my tuition and I'm letting them down, so I'm torn between disappointing them by not going back next semester and just trying to find a job good enough to pay rent or buy a car to live in or going back and disappointing them with a failing grade and wasting money. I'm a complete idiot to have done this, I knew I would fail at it when I left high school and I allowed myself to believe I had a chance. I'm a manchild who can't manage time, the literal bare minimum of courses (I already had to drop one because of a miscommunication in the syllabus), I don't have a lot of friends, I don't do much with my passions/hobbies even.

2023-10-23,1698093417,Feeling lonely,"I don't want to come off as whiny or as someone who complains when I make this reddit post, but being a freshman and having no friends is more isolating than I thought it would be. In high school, I never ""felt lonely"" per se. My best friend who is still the closest person to me as of today, was always by my side and we did everything together, so the real feeling of loneliness never came to me. I was never into the party scene, big groups of people, and I was a wallflower at big functions, however, I was not introverted and always put in the effort when talking to people. Coming to a commuter school, mainly to save money and stay at home, feels like the biggest mistake, because it made me realize that I can't focus or feel comfortable knowing I feel completely lonely. (This might sound dramatic I'm sorry) I feel like I shouldn't be complaining because there are people who have felt this way their whole lives, and now i'm bitching about it because it finally hit me. 

I know that people here might have already formed groups from their high school, but sitting in the loud parts of the library make me feel embarrassed for myself I can't form these connections like other people. I've become good acquaintances with some people, but it always feels like a one time hello, and no real connections come out of it, and I am tired of these interactions. Even joining clubs, everyone somehow already knows each other, and it really hurts sitting there in a corner alone. (SO DRAMATIC LOL) I even try approaching people first, but it's like they couldn't even bother.

Like I said earlier, I don't really do parties (I'm sober and don't plan on ever getting drunk or high) but atp I would go to a party just to please someone to be their friend. I'm honestly not looking forward to halloween , my favorite holiday, knowing how lonely it would feel. It makes me wonder if I should have spent the money to dorm instead of going through this. I have a friend who dorms in a single room, and she's having trouble too. I thought it would be better as a commuter, to make friends though connections rather than having a set plan that creates immediate friendships, but I also don't want to be a financial burden to my parents.  

I know this is a very sad and dramatic post, but I want genuine advice. I'm so foreign to this feeling of loneliness. Please don't picture me as someone to complains about the small things. I've never been an out of the box person, and like I said, I've only ever had one real friend. I want to know how to get over this feeling.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17eufbq/feeling_lonely/
2023-10-23,1698080213,Graduating in 3 vs 3.5 Years,"Hello!

So after looking at the courses I have left to do for my major, I realized that I can graduate a semester early. I even realized that I can graduate a full year early if I just add an extra class each semester. Now, spending the most time here would be the most ideal, The main reason as to why I would consider graduating a full year is because I still I really would like some input on what I should do and any advice would be beneficial. 

3 1/2 yrs.

* Feel less FOMO if I stay the semester
* Would still be able to participate in organizations that I enjoy very much + more time with friends
* More time on the campus that I consider a home

3 yrs.

* Would save thousands of dollars (approx 10k+) compared to 3.5 yrs. (I am taking out loans and financing education myself.)
* Would get a head start on masters degree (2 year social work program which is costly)
* Would avoid the awkward break in the spring where I don't have school and at home
* I want to be done with school and am tired of the work
* Would avoid dealing with housing

I think at the end of the day, graduating in 3 years would be nice so I would not have to extend my schooling longer than I have to, especially because I have to go to grad school, and I can save thousands of dollars, but the main reason I want to do 3.5 is so I can do my clubs/organizations for one more semester and I know that college is not just academics.

So is there anyone taking chemical engineering that thinks their college does really well with teaching?

Ive been in therapy for three years now because, to put it simply, somethings not right w/ my brain. Over those three years, Ive been diagnosed with a couple of different mental illnesses, but dont receive medication for any of them (by choice. Ive considered changing this decision, but I dont want to start medication while at college)

Recently, my mental health has completely spiraled and Im in the worst mental state ive ever been in. My therapist a few weeks ago suggested that I take a leave of absence so i can take some time to seek treatment and idk.. learn how to live again.

The problems im facing about the leave of absence revolve completely around my father. 

1) My older sister dropped out of college and he has (multiple times) disclosed his disappointment in her for doing so. Im scared of being a disappointment 

2) My dad is paying for my college. Im scared that taking a leave of absence will mean I have to pay by myself when I come back. While i know theres lots of people who pay by themselves, the opportunity to have it paid for in full is one i dont want to give up

3) (the big one) My dad doesnt believe in mental illness. He straight up told me I was lying about my experiences just to get attention. 

I cant even begin to imagine the conversation with him if i told him i wanted to take a leave of absence because of mental health. Honestly I fear that, not only would i lose his funding, but that id get kicked out of my family home as well. 

Its just scary and difficult because I know that this leave is what I need to get better (because ill actually be able to seek treatment and also take a break from the hell of college) but i feel like im trapped where i am out of fear",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17b83ep/wanting_to_take_a_leave_of_absence_but_terrified/

2023-10-17,1697510539,"Lack of Social ""Fabric"" In College?","First semester freshman here, and college feels so different from high school socially. There's like much less of a clique culture on campus, and it feels more like a city environment and less like a school environment in terms of socialization (if you get what I mean). There are huge age gaps here, and there's grown adults in some of my classes.

I'm halfway through this semester, and I haven't really found any friends to hang out with, which is expected as I'm only a freshman, but still a little weird. Everybody has their own schedule, unlike in high school, so I'm not forced to be with the same students everyday during classes and lunch back in high school, which I appreciate the freedom, but, man, it gets kind of lonely when there's no familiar faces around. It's so....inconsistent. I'm introverted, so I used to observe other students back in high school, like sitting down on the same lunch table everyday to see what wild shenanigans an underclassmen friend group would get into, or listen to what colleges my peers wanted to apply to.  Now, there's no sense of consistency--people aren't around the same places everyday, and so I just end up wandering around.

I know that it'll get better as I get into my upper division courses and people from my major are there, but I instantly feel that there's something about high school society that college has lost, I just don't know what it is.

Besides that, my SAT is currently holding at an 1190 (I didnt study for it) and I dont know that Ill have time to raise it by the 2nd of December to get into University of Miami.

Additionally, I really would like to travel and spend some time abroad in Europe while working. I am thinking about modeling for fun if I go there and seeing where it goes. My fathers friend who is the one providing me an internship at the naval company strongly recommends taking a gap year. To travel the world will broaden your horizons to many new things. 

I am also quite exhausted. Ive dealt with crippling and debilitating mental illness and I need a break. I need to allow my mind to rest for some time.

Hi everyone! I know this is a hard question to answer, but I am confused as to what I should do. For the past two years I have been working in a special ed classroom as an aide and doing two classes a semester, so Ive completed technically a year of college. 

Ive always wanted to be a school counselor, but the journey there would take so long. Whether I did it full time now or did it slowly, as I would have 5 years left (if full time) and even longer my current way.

Moreover, if I did it full time, I can get a scholarship for the bachelors but not for the masters program, which is very expensive. I would have to either save up money or take out a loan.

College just doesnt make sense to me, but I want to do it. I guess Im just stuck because I am so late to the game of schooling.

I have a good idea of what I would like to work in when I graduate (Data Analytics/Data Engineering), and I have currently secured an internship in that line of work already for next Summer. If all goes well, that company would be willing to have me back after my 3rd year to start full-time (or I would find another company and go full-time there). The other option is to get a 1-year Masters and use that to propel myself into higher-paying work straight out of college. I can also just stay where I am for the full 4 years. 

For context, I am lucky enough that I financially have the option of graduating early or staying the full 4. My first 3 years are fully paid. If I graduate early, I would avoid taking on loans in the 4th year, and I would graduate debt-free. If I stay the full 4, I still take them on, but they will be manageable and I believe I'll be able to pay them relatively quickly if I spend my money wisely.

As I reflect, the only real reason why I would want to study another year (at undergrad or masters) is because of 1) the fear of missing out on a last year of my undergrad experience and 2) the fear of jumping into the workforce so soon. I guess it is just very intimidating to go straight into the workforce for 40/hrs a week while my friends are still studying in college.

On the other hand, I am really excited about the prospect of financial independence, and I have worked 40/hr weeks before at previous internships and I manage it well. I am excited about the career I plan to go into, and it would be great to get a headstart on building my skills in the real world.

Another piece in the issue is that I had told the company that I will be interning for that I plan to graduate in 3 years, and that is their expectation. If that changes, I am not sure how that will go over with them.

Howdy I need some advice, I am a Freshman swimmer at a D3 private college and this is my first semester at the campus. The class I am struggling in is Programming 1 and I can hardly figure out how to write any of the programs that we are assigned for homework. It is all just really confusing for me and I can't seem to get any of the programs I try to write to work. I have gotten help from professors and a tutor for this class before but I still hardly understand what to do. I feel this constant anxiety in my chest and also this dread that won't go away and even when I'm in class I feel like crying constantly because I feel so stupid for not understanding.  This class is just making me really upset and it's starting to affect the work ethic in my other classes. 

Originally I had to take this class due to it being a requirement for a computer science degree but I decided to switch to biology. Right now in the class, I have a 74% as a grade which I know is a C but I don't think I can keep that grade up to a C. I am not worried too much about loss of credit because I came into college with a semester's worth of credits from high school. But I really am worried about being a disappointment to my family and swim coach. My parents are okay with me dropping the class because they know I feel really stressed from the class but I still feel depressed that I'm wasting their money on that class. Secondly, I'm worried about my swim coach because if I drop this class I will go under the NAIA credit requirement and I won't be able to swim until next semester. I have talked to my coach about dropping it but he is convinced that I should try and stay in the class but I haven't told him about how stressed I am through from the class. I really want to drop this class but I feel like such a failure if I do. Any advice or words would be great.

My first year I didnt have a rodent problem, there was only issues with the hot water not turning on. My second year a mouse was caught in a trap in my room the first semester. The second semester I found mouse shit all in my drawers when moving out. Other girls on that floor also found dead mice in their room. AND JUST RIGHT NOW I made eye contact with another mouse. It was under my bed. 

What do I do about this? Thousands of dollars spent to live on campus and my roommates are rodents. My room is not dirty and I never keep food out, so its not my fault. My last dorm blamed the students on being dirty  instead of acknowledging that the dorm building had issues with exterminating mice. 

Now Im worried theyre in my drawers again. My shoes that were in my drawers (that I didnt wear) had a bunch of mouse shit in them last semester. Is this not a health issue? 

Edit: last semester I emailed whoever is in charge on running the dorms.

One of my parents supported this, saying that school should be the most important thing in my life right now.

I don't have any bills or notes to pay, I still pay for my own gas, and I save most of the money that I've earned from my job.

So I'm in Computer Networking. I have this class that I absolutely love, that is about computer maintenence and fixing boot problems etc....

So the professor is very hard on us, barely teaches in class and tells us to read the textbook or we will fail. Basically tells us we aren't smart if we don't get 80's on his tests, but no one ever can.

So I messed up big time and am suffering from immense regret right now.

I chose the wrong university (University of Toronto) because of stupid reasons and regret it so much now. The other university (University of Waterloo) was just better in every aspect for my major(Computer Engineering) and I definitely would be more successful graduating from there than from my current uni. But I made a very immature choice, listened to the wrong people and now I'm here. The regret is so intense that it's making me perform terrible in my exams/midterms because I keep beating myself up for messing up so much. I don't think I can move on.

I am thinking of dropping out from my current uni and reapplying as a freshman to UofWaterloo because I want to get in so bad. Also, they don't really accept transfers and even when they do, the faculty of engineering does not allow for transfer of credits, so I'll have to restart from year 1. My only option is now to drop out and reapply as a freshman.

But there's one problem. I'll lose out on a year.... One year is fine with me but the thing is I've already taken a gap year before beginning university so technically I'll be 2 years behind if I decide to drop out. So I'm not sure if it's worth it or not at this point considering how good UWaterloo engineering is.

Thankfully, money is not really an issue but if I drop out now and take a gap year, I won't have to pay the next semester's tuition fee and that will save me a ton of money especially since I'm an international student.

I'm really lost and confused. Can anyone please help and advise me?",college,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qeldx/is_it_worth_it_to_take_a_gap_year_to_get_into_a/

2023-11-07,1699401156,Choosing a major is giving me the heebie jeebies. Any guidance?,"I am a senior in a high school that is utterly obsessed with getting its students either A) into fancy prestigious colleges or B) massive scholarships. And it definitely works for a lot of people considering the alumni I've heard about or personally know. Most everyone here is the stereotypical ideal for an admission candidate. We have a whole class dedicated to the college process, which means I'm forced to think about it even more than I would of my own volition.

The problem is: while our counselor is astounding when it comes to help with the actual application process, she has *zero* to offer in terms of deciding a major. She has repeatedly told me that I'm a ""dream to have at any campus"" because I excel at most every academic field and have ""such epic writing skills."" I genuinely do not think this matters nor do I agree with her, so please do not take this as bragging, I promise that's not the intention. But it means she thinks I could do *anything*, and as such just keeps telling me to do what I care about most.

I was raised with the idea that college is 100% solely for the sake of later acquiring a job. And, to an extent, I still hold this belief. But I do not have a dream job that is physically possible in the slightest, so I don't know what I should be majoring in. I always wanted to be a *musician* of all things, but my father made sure to crush the dream early because he wanted me to grow up to be either a computer scientist or a housewife. A failed musician of a kid would be ""embarrassing to the family name."" Which means that I can't exactly pull a 180 and major in songwriting because I was never given the opportunity to learn guitar, or piano, or anything (I've been trying to make up for lost time learning the first, but I clearly cannot get to a performable level fast enough for admission deadlines lol). 

I know that you can change majors once you're actually a student there as well as I also know a lot of universities don't require you declare your major immediately, but a good chunk of them have limits on changes (e.g. you can't move between colleges within a uni or majors are blocked by an audition requirement). I've only applied to public schools so far because I wanted time to clean up my more pressing essays instead of applying EA anywhere important, and at those I've gone for Mathematics as a major, but I don't really care about mathematics? Like, I know I'm very good at it (that's something I'm willing to brag a bit about), and it's always my favorite homework, but I'm not *passionate* about it. And if I truly was throwing passion away for the sake of thinking about college in terms of jobs, I guess I should be going for Finance or Statistics instead because those are more sought after?

I don't know. Somebody tell me how to figure this out, or tell me where to start rethinking please and thank",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17q8c6c/choosing_a_major_is_giving_me_the_heebie_jeebies/
2023-11-07,1699394343,Has anybody else ever survived 7 consecutive semesters of academic probation and graduated?,"Has anybody else ever threaded this needle? I successfully graduated college after 7 consecutive semesters on academic probation. I feel that this must be a highly statistically improbable event; I. think I am the only person in the history of my university to do so.

Some background- I grew up as a GT kid. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Tourette's syndrome in my early teens, and was proscribed adderall for the attention deficit issues. I graduated high school with 27 college credits, and went to a state school on a scholarship for Presidential Leadership Program, a specialized minor. I graduated high school right when the economy collapsed from the 2008 financial crisis, So I went in with financial issues.

My freshman year I made a stupid decision; I decided to go cold turkey on my adderall, be cause I did not want to be physiologically dependent on a chemical. I did not anticipate withdrawal. I couldn't get out of bed for three weeks as ten years of amphetamines worked their way out of my system. I went from  straight A's to failing 2 classes. This was a new experience for me, I had always been scholastically gifted, and this failure put me into a deep depression. Come spring semester, I had recovered and was ready to get back at it, but I found out I was formally put on academic probation by the university as my GPA was below a 2.0. This meant that I could only enroll in 4 classes a semester. One of these courses was a 200 level German course. I have a profound issue with learning foreign languages; I scored an 800 on the SAT verbal, but I just can't seem to crack others (I've attempted to learn 5- Latin, Spanish, French, German, Dutch). this 200 level course was a requirement to graduate, so I had to pass it. I failed this course 4 consecutive times.

From My second semester freshman year to when I walked at graduation, I was on formal academic probation. Academic probation exists in a narrow range of GPAs. Drop below the threshold, and you are kicked out. rise above the threshold and you are off academic probation. I had a 3.8 average in my major, but because I kept failing the language course over and over and could only take 4 classes at a time, The impact of the high grades in my core focus, averaging to the 0 of the F meant that my GPA per semester was automatically at 75%. I couldn't take any academic risks by taking courses i wasn't sure I could get an A in, even 400 level history courses. no pottery class for me! I had enough credits to graduate by Junior year, but I still didn't have the language course.

Each year of school the band for academic probation gets narrower and narrower. starting from a band of .40, by senior year the margin of error was .02. Junior year the band was only .10 of a grade point.

I Literally have never heard of someone graduating under these conditions, it was a statistical fluke that i was put into an administrative catch 22 that wouldn't allow me to take enough classes to climb out.  How unusual is this?

Post script- After graduating I toured around Europe for a while as a muralist, and after that jumped into the corporate world and work as a international Business Director in tech, so it all worked out well in the end.

The only hope I have of scraping by with a C is to get 100% on all my exams, quizzes, and homeworks which is unlikely. Unfortunately, I wont be able to take any of major specific classes for next semester unless I pass calc first. I already completed all my ged eds save for one (which Im currently taking) so if I retake calc next semester (spring) it would be the only class Id have that semester. It would push everything back by a semester and delay my expected graduation. I checked and the class isnt available over the winter so spring would be the soonest semester I could retake it. 
I just feel like such a failure and cant imagine how to break the news to my parents that I may have to delay graduation due to my own negligence.

Edit: Im taking Calc 1 and the class is fully online with no class meetings or recorded lectures. Every week there is homework posted on MyOpenMath and the quiz or exam is released on Thursdays and due on Sunday by midnight. Were expected to take the assessments on examinity for proctoring to prevent cheating. 

MyOpenMath is structured so that the quiz tab is lowkey hidden compared to the homework. The link to the homework is clear in blue, but the link for the quiz takes 2 clicks to access so I tend to overlook when its due and dont check examity to complete the weeks quiz. However, the thing with examity is that it doesnt let you take the test if youre an hour away from the deadline (midnight). I found this out the hard way when I logged to take my exam (worth more than quiz) at 11 pm and wasnt able to access it which caused me to not take it and get a 0.

2023-11-05,1699226823,Horrible time after college. Can any relate?,"After graduating I didn't get a job like I thought, after applying for everything I could find.
It was really degrading to see nobody would hire me, when I knew I would provide value. For the past three years I felt like university would be my ticket out of hell, but it didn't work out that way.

By the time I graduated I was on top of the world, I felt like the best I've ever been mentally and physically.

Sadly, after that I had to go back to the only places I could get hired, and work in miserable manual labour.

After 1 year of the worst job I've ever had. I had to stop working due to a bad back injury which is still not better 1 year after I quit. The job I worked was meant to be an gap year before I went back for postgraduate studies. 
Instead I was so overworked I developed severe chronic fatigue that I could barely get through a day, but I kept enduring because I don't know my own limits and I've always been a crazy hard worker.

So the past year I've been on unemployment, I used up all my savings, and I'm basically disabled. 
It has been horrible and the past 7 months I've been in the darkest pits of human misery imaginable. 
I don't know how I have refrained from suicide, but I won't give up.

Now, I am thinking to try to transitions into Tech after I get a Comptia cert. But my future is very unclear. I can't afford to go back to university.

It's a shame, but if I never had that job that injured me, I would probably already have my postgraduate degree right now, and I wouldn't be disabled. It has really got me down very very low. But I can only accept reality and try to recover from this time. And hopefully I can get my life back on track.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17oowe5/horrible_time_after_college_can_any_relate/

(It could help to mention that I have hard times focusing)
I am a college freshman (law) and I hate what Im studying.

 I wasnt interested in law, but it looked like the only academic subject that I could pick. I thought Id get interest once in there, but I like it even less than before (the atmosphere, people, way of talking, organisation&).

The only reason I stay is because a degree gets you more choices in life (professionally speaking), and after not really having the choice on what to study, I dont want the same to happen the rest of my career.

In highschool, I could at some point put myself to work because it was either interesting or at least not VERY interesting, but now, I find it actively uninteresting and cant even read my lessons for long.

My parents have done too munch to offer me a comfortable life, and are happy that Im supposed to spend a year studying in an other country (which I dont like but again, double diploma= more choice) but I dont know if I have the level to.
I dont want to disappoint them.

Because of that, I really want to finish to both make them proud and to leave this field that I dont like.

So the question is: **how do you put yourself to work on something you could care less about ?**

is me. all this said I have 3 main questions/advice i could use.

1. is there anything at all i can do to lower these costs? ive already begged for more money (they gave me $4k more in aid woohoo), applied to a million scholarships, and have a work study and a part time job.

2.  realistically, will i be able to land a good enough job in my field after school to pay off 160k in debt without completely setting myself up for financial ruin? or should i just go ahead and transfer back to my subpar but still decent state school (UGA)?

3. music is my passion and my real dream is to work in the music/entertainment business. i know it will be much more fulfilling than working in an econ/corporate/government environment, but the pay on average across the music industry field is just sooo much less unless you really make it big or grind up the corporate ladder (for bigger publishing and record label companies). does it make any sense to pursue this career path, or should i just focus in school for a steadier job? i know people be saying pursue your dreams or else youll regret it later in life, but i feel like id also regret having hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt lol.

For context, I went to my safety school, DePauw, because they offered me a full ride as well as paying for a semester abroad, pretty good deal compared to paying 20-30k a year at UMich. However, the classes Im taking are just not challenging, its just a lot of busy work. In econ Im learning the same things I did in HS, in French the 300 level course is way below my level because the next hardest course I could take is the capstone course which Im not allowed to take (I have to take 3 more French courses in order to get to that and do a minor, so it basically just means slogging through lower level courses that wont help me at all). What Id like to do with French is get it out of the way so I can learn a different language, as I can already speak decent French so its more so about having a piece of paper that says I can do it.

I got frustrated and upset. In the beginning, I thought about just keeping quiet and not bursting out but then a few minutes I couldn't take it so I told my parents. Then, I cried in my room really terribly to the point that everyone can hear. This made my Father stressed and he got extremely angry about the fact and told me he won't speak to me for one week to make me learn that parents have their own issues too and cannot get stressed about adult children (Tbh, I have complained to him and expressed frustration immaturely a lot of times over the past year about my low scores and low GPA). That is my fault and I do not know how to cope. I feel angry back towards my Father but those feelings of anger do not make sense when I was wrong here.

 Honestly, complaining to them has been a coping mechanism for me and I do not know any other way to react to such low results other than being emotional about it. I have too much stress over this issue and that I have to at least pass this course.

2023-10-31,1698769469,Failed semester due to insatisfaction,"I failed the semester.

Context is key here. I'm 21. I'm from a small country in which college isn't like in the US.
You go for a class one day. You do homework through online modules. That's it. It's a very distant college experience.

Life has become boring to me. Or rather, insatisfactory. Part of me wishes I could hang out with other people. Interact with others in class. Meet up on weekends and stuff. Just the bare minimum. Anything other than staying in my room playing videogames. I feel myself wasting away. So, driving 30 minutes for a 3 hour class with no social interaction. Or logging in online to do boring homework. It just doesn't sound appealing. And I know not everything in life is fun. But something must be. Back in school, I didn't have this problem. Sure, homework was borderline exvessive and not all classes were interesting. But there was a trade-off. People. People that talk. Classmates to spend time with. To do homework and projects together. 14 year old me would kill me but, I miss group assignments. That was enough for me. Enough for me to put in the effort. It was a good trade-off and my last years of school were challenging, but also beautiful.

 A bit of context here is where I live: People here are not the best at being social. Usually the problem is that one is too introverted. For me, the problem is being too extroverted. People don't like socializing. They get too awkward or defensive if you approach them. So that's kind of what makes this problem. We are very closed people over here and everyone lives inside their own homes all the time or they are party animals that go to discos. There are obviously good traits in everyone, though. But, I'm tired. I've been trying the whole year to look for ""a place"" somewhere where people can be more... open. And I've found out, there isn't in this small city. So I'm changing fields.

I'm moving to a dorm in the US next year. I've always loved it at dorms. Always made friends without problems. I gotta wait until summer since that's when freshman usually enter as adviced by my counsellor. That's too damn long. But anyways. Life moves on. Gotta try again and keep trying.

(I was wearing gear) The guy who hit me ran off.. An ambulance picked me up and sent to the hospital with fractured body parts and a dislocated shoulder. It was a shit show because they never found the dude but I kept up a smile and a good attitude so I don't need people worrying so much about it. I took about a 2 week break before heading back and talked to the health faculty for cases like this. I talked to my professors and everything. All I had to do was catch up. Well, at first it was okay and I slowly built a repetition of schooling again until more recently, the haunting feeling of my depression began eating at me. I became mentally drain with everything I do, and more physically and mentally fatigue as the hours went by. I would just stress over everything. The more the week went by, the more I felt like I'm the burden of my family with my medical bills and my professors becoming annoyed of me for constantly asking for old assignments that keeps stacking over me. I'm at this point where I want to quit school for the remainder of the semester and take a break to recover myself but I feel like I'm already so far in. I'm extremely behind on my work but I can take this alternative route where I just drop my classes and click the reset button but it feels like I failed. It's called the catastrophic withdraw.

2023-10-30,1698682486,Whatre some careers you could go into with a BA in Math?,"I had a subpar GPA due to some personal issues (though my major GPA is still decent) so Im not considering a Masters at the moment, maybe after a few years of working. But it seems that most suggested careers for math majors either require higher-level maths or extensive domain-knowledge in another field. For example, being an economist requires economics, actuarial science requires the actuary exams, data science and statistics jobs strongly prefer graduate degrees, engineering and other related areas require applied math (among other things), and I have no interest in anything related to academia. So what options do I even have?

For additional context, Im finishing up my final year at a pretty good public university in the USA. My major is math (no applied math option at my school though the classes Ive taken have definitely leaned towards it) and I have a minor in philosophy. Ive also taken the foundational courses for statistics and optimization (introductory statistics 1-2, probability theory, statistical theory, machine learning, numerical analysis, linear optimization, mathematical modeling, advanced linear algebra) and have decent coding/CS knowledge (proficiency in Java up to data structures level, proficiency in Python, particularly in terms of numerical methods and machine learning, R, Excel, and some databases).

Right now it seems like my best bet is to start taking the actuary exams (I can do P and FM before I graduate). Or to self-study mathematical finance and hope to break into that field. Data science and SWE seem to be out of reach as theyre competitive and require more advanced topics in statistics and CS, respectively.",college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17jx20f/whatre_some_careers_you_could_go_into_with_a_ba/

They are not allowed any other small appliances&except for a blender.  I plan to buy her a small compact blender for Christmas.

What foods should I include in her box?

Shell be driving, not flying, so a reasonable box should fit in her trunk.

2023-10-30,1698624061,Looking for direction as a Computer Science student,"I want to begin this post by saying I'm a 25 year old financially independent college-student who enrolled into a 4-year university in Fall 2022. I have my associates for a liberal arts degree, and started to code as a hobby shortly after receiving it. I ended up enjoying it enough that I wanted to pursue it as a career and decided to enroll in my town's university (KU). This past year has been one of the most difficult and confusing parts of my life and I'm starting to question whether or not the option of a 4-year degree is suitable for me.

I know it is small compared to others, but I have accrued over $8,000 in debt and I have little to show for it in terms of Computer Science knowledge. I've been maintaining an A in my comp sci classes such as Programming 1 and 2, but I've severely struggled with other required classes such as Calculus 3 and Physics. I've dropped my Physics class last semester and seriously doubt I am going to pass my Calc 3 course this semester. I was also diagnosed with ADHD last month and am in the process of receiving accommodations.

However even with accommodations, my poor performance this past year has taken a serious blow to my mental health and confidence in obtaining my degree by Fall 2025. I have taken barely any computer science classes and to be honest, the amount of time and money spent on concepts adjacent to Computer Science seem to distract me from time I could have spent independently studying or pursuing a bootcamp. My performance will almost certainly affect my financial aid and add even more stress of barely being able to afford living expenses.

I am at the point of feeling so burnt out I'm not even sure that continuing in a University would be a good idea financially and for my own mental health. I'm barely able to see friends anymore and I'm under constant stress of being able to afford necessities.  Is a 4-year degree in Computer Science really necessary in the field to be successful?  I am not trying to rise to the tippy top but just want to live a comfortable lifestyle without constantly living paycheck to paycheck.",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17jge2u/looking_for_direction_as_a_computer_science/

All of the classes at ASU are accelerated, which is honestly fine. The workload can be a little overbearing but thats not why I had to withdraw from any classes. I was taking summer classes earlier this year, and withdrew from one of them because I had family stuff going on that completely distracted me from school and at the time I was also working overtime every single week at Starbucks so I had fallen so behind I couldnt possibly get a passing grade. And then the next time I withdrew from my classes was because of the same reasons- my family issues and work schedule prevented me from being able to be as present as I should have been in my classes and they moved so fast that I had fallen extremely behind. Now, Im about to have to withdraw from a class because of financial reasons. This class requires a textbook, which wasnt cheap- but I got it. But once you buy the textbook you also have to buy access to the workbook that all of our assignments are in as well as an additional fee to be able to talk to our professor which is a mandatory assignment. Its only 2 weeks into the course, but Im already super behind because I cannot afford the textbooks that I need to do half of the assignments.

Its only 2 weeks into the class, out of 6- but no late work is accepted and I currently have a 30. Multiple assignments are due tonight which will drop my grade lower, and Im unsure if I should just drop the class and take it next semester and make sure I have enough money for it- or if I should instead try to salvage my grade and buy the textbook after my next pay day.

Ive had the routine of taking four classes a semester which has been working out for me fairly well as Ive been keeping up with my grades. As a result from a mistake thats entirely my own, I registered earlier on for a course that started later in the semester and was expected to be accelerated. I didnt mind at all because I knew what I signing up for. But I didnt calculate how difficult one of my classes would be until now. 

I have one course in particular that has been very time consuming. I tend to dedicate a lot of my brain to it so I can have a shot at a good grade (professor is a hard grader). Anyways, once this last course of mine started, which is sociology, I looked through the modules and realized there were five essays assigned to be submitted until mid December. The first two had six days between due dates, then there is a three week break period between the third, forth, and fifth essays which each also had six days between due dates. 

Normally, I dont think this would be a big deal, however, this one course contains a lot of thought provoking assignments, hence why it takes so long to do them. I have a larger essay due for this course toward the end of November as well as other course assignments to fit in that are also slightly time consuming. Additionally, theres finals I have to worry about. My concern is that Im going to overwork myself and turn in mediocre work that wont receive a good grade.

I'd been hyping myself up for a while for it, had the entire summer of being excited and anxious and then the time came, and ever since I've been living it up here and having the time of my life. It's a good school, absolutely love the laidback vibes and the people here, chose it over a much more prestigious school and I don't regret that at all.

I've always heard that basically everyone gets a little homesick in the first few months especially as a freshman since it's the first time you're away from home for so long. I was preparing myself to feel that, but for some reason it just never came. I don't miss home at all. I feel a lil guilty when I say that.

Maybe it's because home for me is only like two to three hours away, but I feel like it's not completely because of that since I literally just don't think about home at all. I haven't had the thought of ""oh I can always go back home when I want"" once. Maybe it's because I came from a bit of toxic competitive high school where I felt dumb all the time, and I'm meeting so many people who are actually normal and just as lost as I am. Maybe it's because I was constantly butting heads with my parents and I needed some space for myself. My household wasn't super toxic, but Asian parents lol

I miss my friends. I miss eating good Asian food all the time. I miss my family, I guess. I kind of miss knowing everyone around me and feeling close to my class, but I also kind of love the freedom that comes with not knowing everyone. That's kind of it though. I guess when I think about home, I remember that all my friends are also going through the same things and we're all trying to make the next steps of our lives, and being back home just feels like I'm going back on that progress.

And I know I'm fortunate to not feel homesick because a lot of people are struggling with that, my friend already flew back home because she couldn't take it anymore lol.

2.  theres always a first in everything. 
3. things im anxious about usually turn out better than expected.

2023-11-11,1699669139,How Can I Prepare for College-Level Reading?,"TLDR; I'm asking for tips for reading comprehension and getting prepared for college-level reading from any current or prospective college student who has a better education than I did. Any help will be appreciated. 

Reading is not my strong suit.

Basically, I stopped reading grade-level books in 7th grade. I did online school up to 9th grade, then I was in high school for a month, and the only grade-level book we read as a class was ""The House on Mango Street"" which I wasn't even there to finish. A year later I got my GED and it's just basic reading, so I don't actually have high school knowledge of reading. 

Whenever I write scholarship essays, Grammary almost always says my text is likely to be understood by 9th graders (15-year-olds) which is about the same time I stopped going to school. So I try to throw in more advanced vocabulary to sound more educated, shorten or lengthen some of my sentences as needed and that might amp it up to college level. I'm 17 years old and I will be a freshman in college with the reading skills of a student at the high school freshman level. :/

I've always enjoyed reading, especially non-fiction, memoirs, autobiographies, history, crime, and thrillers. How can I tie that into getting up to college-level reading? I have two months to prepare before I start college and I want to read as much as possible and get to that level of reading I need to be at. The GED was the first step in the door to college, but it did not prepare me well. 

Some books I have are Jane Eyre, The Scarlet Letter, and Pride and Prejudice, which are at higher reading levels than I am used to.

Advice appreciated","I'm in my 6th year at undergrad feeling unable to finish my degree and unsure of what to do. Part of me feels like my current path is futile but I also know that dropping out would make my life way harder.

This is pretty embarrassing, but due to my depression and misc. inability to thrive at my school, I've essentially been repeating the same classes I've needed to graduate for 3 years. The only reason I haven't been academically dismissed at this point is because I've had 2 of those years retroactively wiped under a medical withdrawal due to my mental health. I took one semester off afterward and got medicated, which helped a bit but I'm still struggling.

The past three semesters were each supposed to be my ""last semester"" but ended the same, with me needing to push back my graduation because I failed my classes. Likewise, this semester was supposed to be my last but I can't stop seeming to make the same mistakes because I'm going to need another semester or two to finish, depending on if I get put on probation again.

My issue is this: I have a full-time job offer that I'm supposed to start after I graduate. I already asked them to push my start date back once I realized I won't be graduating this semester. I got this offer through an internship from this summer that I enjoyed and would really like to come back. But I have little faith in my ability to finish school.

The answer seems pretty simple which is to do my best the remainder of this semester so I can pass a class or two and take the rest next semester. At this point I've spent way too much on tuition, need this degree for my offer, and am too close (in credits anyway19 left including this semester) to drop out. But after 3 years of repeating the same pattern every semester I'm wondering if I'm just wasting my time and money. I'm on two medications for my depression, went through a handful of therapists, and was in two therapy groups, and nothing seems to change in the long run. All my energy, motivation, and productivity just die the moment I come back to school.

I guess I am looking for advice or stories from anyone who's been through anything similar. Online classes are not an option at my school by the way, otherwise I would not be on campus lol. I realize in retrospect that I should have just gone part-time every semester and I would have still graduated earlier than it's looking like now, but I can't change the past.

Let me introduce my self, I'm 20 years old boy from Europe. I try to not waiste any time and i try to spend time as efficient as possible, because I know, what I'm doing right now affect on my future life. With that said, im going in the gym almost everyday, taking diet very seriously (couting carbs, not eating any sugar envolved foods(only that comes from natural ones)), not drinking, smoking or vaping. I'm trying to do some creating some content during my free time, because I have a vision that it might change my life. I feel like studies aren't the thing, that you can become financially independent from.

In my family, I feel like I'm the one that is trying to improve as much as possible and spending every second as efficient as possible. They think weird about my diet, gym, but I don't pay attention to it, becausd I know this is the right thing for me, to become best version of myself. Ofcourse I love them, they treat me well and I'm thankfull them for doing it. 


Im september I started to study Software Engineering in university. I don't have to pay for it, because goverment pays. They let people who graduate from high school with a particular score to study free (at least in my country).Started well, got to know a lot people, university offered some kickboxing classes, I tried and really liked it.. Im not going to get on details, what I liked and what not, i'll go stright to the point. In this month we started taking tests. I pased some and didn't passed few(Math ones) and those hit me really hard, even tho im not a 'A' student. Why it hiy me hard, I think because I was really preparing for them for some time and I feel like, I waisted that time. Some students haven't study that much or haven't study at all and passed it. Ofcourse I'll have another try in December. 

The main reason why it hit me hard, because I try so hard in most of the things that I face, is because of my family. My overall goal is to make them financial freedom, so they wont care about my financial situation and they wouldnt have to worry about theirs.

I can't focus for very long. During lectures I lose focus after like 5 - 30 min. I have to reread something (could be extremely simple) before I understand it. When working in groups, everyone is fast but I am always the slowest one. When I am watching recorded lectures of 2h, it takes me 5h+. Because I lose focus, talk to myself. Go up and talk to others or scroll down social media. I get headache if I focus too much. We had an interview project and while asking questions, I lost focus and didn't hear a word my interviewee said. I am so dumb I couldn't tell you their name if I hadn't written it beforehands. 

This all in all is leading to me spending 247 on school work. Is there anything I can do to get better? Anyone going thru the same? I feel kinda lonely.

2023-11-08,1699433502,"If literally 99% of students won't go into research for some fields (computer science, Electrical engineering, ...) why does teaching focus so much on research?","Some programmes focus heavily on research. I was wondering why that was the case considering that most students won't become researchers. Wouldn't there be a better way to both target (potential) future researchers and people who will go into industry? Like for example, two slightly different study tracks or something?

Another consequent question is why does academia still stick to a model that neither satisfies teachers (who are researchers) nor students (who genuinely need good teachers). It seems that the equation makes life miserable for teachers who'd prefer spending their time researching and students who eventually face grumpy (perhaps rightly so) human beings.

It's a probably naive question from the standpoint of someone who knows the inner workings of academia but I was genuinely curious.

An argument that I see rather often is that if that system has worked well so far why change it? To what I would beg to differ. While it has worked well that doesn't exclude the possibility that it can be improved. But again what do I know haha

It is also empirically true that many job offers require some university degree (sometimes even master's or PhD) but we've seen these requirements change over the years especially in the US where access to education is becoming more and more financially difficult. Thus, this sole metric cannot be taken as a proxy value for college relevance. The job market and its requirements will always adapt to the supply. That's also why we see more and more jobs that used to not require any college degree now require one.

Anyway my two cents. What are your take or insight on the matter? Genuinely curious (especially from an academic perspective)",college,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qhhtf/if_literally_99_of_students_wont_go_into_research/

2023-11-06,1699311852,Advice on potential major/career switch,"


Hi all. Im currently a junior at a highly ranked business school, and Im currently recruiting for consulting/marketing jobs. Although Im actively recruiting for these roles, Ive never really liked business nor the prospect of working in a corporate environment. My choice of going to school as a business major was in-part due to some external family pressure and internal pressure to find something stable. My school is also very well-known for business and I felt a sort of obligation to major in it for that reason.

Ive become increasingly depressed and anxious as a direct result of going through with my major and recruiting for the industry. Living in a major city has also contributed to this, and I cant see myself being able to handle the hustle environment for much longer. I have never felt like myself in my current academic/professional situation, and this feeling has turned my outlook on life to be increasingly negative in the past few months. Naturally my therapist, along with my friends and family, have strongly encouraged me to consider other career options, which has led me to give such options serious thought. I dont mind the prospect of making less money I dont aspire to own or rent things beyond modest means. Going to school for an extra year also wont be an issue, as most of my school so far has been covered via scholarships.

Ive been seriously considering becoming a history/education major and pursuing teaching as a career. I am far aware that teaching has its drawbacks, but the idea of being able to engage with a true passion of mine while doing work that actually means something (to me) seems much preferable to working in a job without that sense of personal impact (Im not saying corporate jobs are meaningless fwiw, just that they dont satisfy my sense of purpose i want from my work). 

I know there are a million next steps from here& Ill see what my career advisor has to say, but I would appreciate any candid input from you guys.

Edit: current plan is to continue recruiting for marketing/consulting until I find an internship for summer 2024 (which would eventually extend to a full-time position). Would ideally have an offer by early December, which would give me at least a cushion if I decide to switch into something else.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17pfwqy/advice_on_potential_majorcareer_switch/

2023-10-31,1698718297,Are you an adult thinking about going to college for the first time? Save a pile of money with CLEP and self study,"If you are an adult thinking about going to college for the first time, it's likely you have a lot of doubts about whether you can even do the work. The doubts get stronger the further you get from high school. If you weren't a great student in high school, you are probably even more concerned.  
  
Try college out for free by taking CLEP credits. CLEP is short for College-Level Examination Program. Basically, you self-study and then you go and take a proctored exam at either an exam center or university testing center. Usually these exams are about $93 to take plus the local exam fee which is usually around $20 or so. The list of subjects is here: https://clep.collegeboard.org/clep-exams  
  
The big issue with CLEP is that you often don't know what CLEP exams your local college will accept until after you take the exam and apply. In other words, you could spend the $93 and have nothing to show for it depending on your local university's policy.  
  
You can mitigate that risk by using free CLEP study materials at Modern States. Website here: https://modernstates.org/  
  
Depending on funding, they offer free CLEP exam certificates if you use their study materials and completely study for the exam. That's a free $93 exam. You just have to pay the local testing fee and sometimes they will even reimburse that. The available CLEP study material is listed here: https://modernstates.org/course/  
  
Another caveat is that often colleges will only accept credits you earned prior to enrollment. In other words, if you sign up for college and then take CLEP, some colleges will only accept the CLEP you had completed before enrollment. If you are already enrolled, speak to a guidance counselor about whether or not you can add CLEP credits.  
  
I went back to school at 37 because I was tired of earning $15 an hour. It had been a long time since high school, so I also used Khan Academy to relearn basic math before I even started any CLEP math.  
  
I have a grad degree today with only $7k in student loan debt and a job in accounting earning $70k in a LCOL.

  
PS- I posted this in r/highereducation AND r/education and they both immediately removed it. They do not want you to save money on college at all.. lol

It is not entirely my fault (I think),"I've been slowly getting a bad cold for a couple of days now and was up all night with intense coughing and aches and pains. I emailed my professor at 6 a.m. because I knew I was not going to be well enough to attend our 1-4 p.m. class. I wrote in the email that I understood that we had an online, in-person quiz today and that I would make myself available whenever it worked best for him, assuming that he needed to proctor or schedule a proctor. I don't hear from him the entire day, but notice he must be on his computer because I see him uploading other coursework to our student portal. At 1 pm exactly, I received a notification that the quiz link was shared with me. I did not open the quiz because I did not think I was allowed to take it. At 1:05, he emailed me that I must start the quiz right that second and that I must submit it by 1:30 p.m. or I will receive a zero. Knowing how quizzes work in the past with this professor, I know that once he enters the classroom on quiz day he logs onto his laptop and tells everyone to be prepared to open the quiz link the moment the clock hits 1 p.m. and we have 30 minutes to take the quiz. Since he emailed me later, I was already at a disadvantage starting a 30-question quiz 5 minutes later than everyone else. I was also caught off guard because I was nervous to submit it even the slightest bit past 1:30 p.m. and had no clue that I would be taking the quiz right then in there. I understand that it would be a possibility, but I just found it a bit unprofessional notifying me the moment I needed to begin. My issue is what if I was not actively checking my email, or if my sickness prevented me from taking the quiz? I did not disclose the extent of my illness so how was he to know I was able to complete the quiz at that time? 

By the end of the quiz, I was filling in random answers because I was running out of time. Although I submitted the quiz at 1:28 p.m. (because I was nervous about submitting it too late), I did very poorly. I received a 58%. Additionally, this professor does not have any section within his syllabus that has the course grading/weights for assignments (he also does not include any information about missing classes/exams for sickness, etc.). Considering that we are almost at the end of the semester and there is a total of 3 assignments/quizzes and 3 more to take, I figure that this quiz weighs high and will completely ruin my good grade.

2023-10-29,1698608000,Choosing Between IT and Philosophy: Seeking Career Guidance,"Hello, I'm currently 19 and just started my first year at university a few months ago. I find myself facing a significant predicament and I'm hoping to seek advice!!

&amp;#x200B;

The main challenge I'm facing revolves around my hatred of mathematics, a crucial component in technology-related fields. Conversely, I have an unwavering passion for philosophy, politics, psychology, sociology, and all things related to the social sciences. I can easily dedicate 8 hours to  reading and continuously write on even the most mundane topics in these subjects. Yet, the mere thought of engaging with math for an hour fills me with dread, leading me to prefer delving into a political theory textbook instead.

My current degree is a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, but I'm contemplating a shift to a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Politics. What's making me feel so apprehensive is the potential lack of a secure career path and financial stability that might accompany this change. I acknowledge that no degree guarantees immediate job prospects; success demands hard work and practical experience. Unfortunately, Arts degrees often carry the stigma of leading to ambiguous career paths.

I can probably endure the annoying discrete math, calculus, and programming classes. However, the end reward seems like a well-paying job in the tech sector, which I'm uncertain that I genuinely care about. While the idea of working remotely, programming, and earning a comfortable income sounds amazing, I'm unsure if that's the lifestyle I envision for myself. What truly makes me happy is the notion of becoming an educator, lawyer, or professor, where I can engage with people directly and make a meaningful difference. I see myself as an artistic individual, drawn to literature and the social sciences, rather than being confined to a corporate programming job for the foreseeable future. Even a master's in argumentation studies sounds like something I would love doing or even law school.

Perhaps my concerns stem from stereotypical assumptions associated with these academic paths. It's plausible that I could carve a path where I pursue a teaching career while also having the flexibility to explore opportunities in the technology sector. I just don't know if that's possible if I take all Philosophy and Poli Sci courses the next 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old student torn between enduring an I.T degree or changing my major to philosophy and politics. I'm worried about future job options, as arts degrees can seem uncertain, but I am willing to put in the work into anything as long as I like it. Unsure if a tech job is for me, dreaming of teaching or law instead. Trying to find a middle ground between my passions and practicality.

2023-10-27,1698389293,Im actually too dumb for Computer Science,"I'm currently enrolled in an introductory Python programming course at university, and I'm struggling so bad right now. While most people I know find this course easy, I'm finding it extremely difficult and often feel lost. I work through the zyBooks assignments each week, taking my time to ensure I grasp the material, yet my classmates who speed through them seem to have a much better understanding of the homework and lab work.

Speaking of the lab, I frequently rely on my lab partners, and since we rotate partners often, it can be somewhat embarrassing to sit quietly, pretending to work on the code while I daydream, and they complete the entire assignment. It's not because I want to do this, but I just get confused and give up a couple times before fully checking out. Almost everyone I talk to in this class either took AP Computer Science in high school or just quickly grasps new concepts. The pace of this course is crazy. We're introduced to concepts like nested loops, arrays, etc., and suddenly we're expected to be experts in these functions, knowing how and when to implement them and understanding their impacts on other python functions. I currently have a B but that's only because I've  resorted to cheating on homework and relying on others in the lab just to get by.

The most frustrating aspect of all of this is not just how challenging it is for me, but how effortless it appears to be for others. I slacked off throughout high school, and I feel like I haven't developed the skills needed to handle these demanding college courses. It's disheartening, especially because this is just the introductory level. I'm determined not to change my major; I want to graduate with a STEM degree, and the idea of becoming a software engineer and the potential salary are motivating factors.

Despite the difficulties, I want to mention that I am learning a lot. It's just that I'm learning at a slower pace and definitely not learning as much compared to others.  My primary concern is how I'll fare in the next course, data structures. I know it's a crucial class, and if I'm struggling now, I fear my chances of success might be slim. I'm seeking your honest opinion, but please,  some words of encouragement.

2023-10-27,1698365259,"Kind of over the undergrad life, but feel bad about it","I'm going to preface this post by saying no shame to people who are into this. I am also a neurodivergent individual, so the way I act and think may seem a little off.

Anyway, I am now a 22 year old senior in college and I'm kind of ready to be done. I graduated high school in 2020, so I had my first year and a half ish taken over by COVID. I went to a very large state school that was far away from home, and ended up transferring out because I was so miserable there. Everyone was going out and partying to the point that they were hungover, and this was multiple times a week. I know that this is typical college behavior, but this was also during a pandemic and I couldn't drink for health reasons. It was really hard for me to find people who have similar values and personalities, but I have found my niche at my current school. It is way more academically rigorous and I'm involved in more serious, time-consuming activities. Whenever I do get free time, which isn't often (and I actually prefer to be kept busy), I play games and just chill with some of my close friends.

This weekend is hard for me since it's Halloweekend and it seems like everyone is going out. I can't as I'm bombarded with midterms, grad school applications, tech week for a show I am in, and just the regular daily life of college. Part of me feels bad and FOMO for not going to Halloween parties. But part of me wants to prioritize these important events. I can celebrate Halloween every year, it's not every day that I have to apply to graduate school. Being off campus has made it easier to not really care what other people are doing on Friday and Saturday night, since I don't really hear or see too much. I'm also trying to limit my social media so I''m not as exposed. I went to a Halloween party last year with my friends and we all left early cause none of us liked it. Part of my disability makes small talk and meeting new people really difficult and uncomfortable. I don't like being in a crowded space with strangers who are extremely drunk. I know that lots of people like this, but this just makes me really uncomfortable and drained. 

It's much better at my current school than my old school. Obviously people are still in college and go out and party, but it's not as often and it's at a lesser extent (mostly frat parties for freshmen and upperclassmen go to apartments or cities, whenever they have time). I love to learn, do puzzles, watch tv, play games, bake, and just chill with friends. I love college and the experiences I've had, but I'm kind of ready to move on. Be with people who have similar values and mindsets. I know people will still go out and have fun, but I feel like it's different from 19 year olds who are finally away from mom and dad for the first time getting wasted. I'm ready to focus on my career and my growth, and just have the opportunity to be more of an adult. I feel really mature for my age anyways. While I love college and it's bittersweet that I'm going to be done in a few months, I'm ready for bigger and better things.

2023-10-25,1698225499,What's your experience with 12 week classes?,"I've only taken 16 week classes before. I always figured there was no way I could manage doing a class in such a condensed time. And I always assumed that spring/summer classes were just online since I started college during COVID (I never really thought about it, made sense that accelerated classes would only be online in my head), but my current school actually offers classes in person, which I definitely prefer.

With certain circumstances this year, I might have to do an accelerated class regardless, and honestly, now I'm thinking it might be a good idea in general? I figure, I need to pass at least 30 credits a year to keep my financial aid. With just Fall/Winter, that's at least 4, maybe 5 classes, which most people seem to be able to do, but it's been a lot to manage for me, especially when trying to keep a job too. And just having one less class sounds like it would be so much less stress and work. So if I did 12 credits in Fall/Winter and maybe 6 in the Spring/Summer, that already sounds a lot more manageable. Even if those 6 credits are accelerated a bit, it's only two classes. It would probably be the same amount of work as 3 classes.

And to be honest, I never really liked summer break. It's fun for the first few weeks where I have tons of freedom to do whatever I want, and then I end up wishing I just had something to do, ruining my sleep schedule for weeks on end...

My focus is to get in, get my degree, and get out as fast as possible. This fall, I enrolled with two 16-week and two 8-week classes, unaware that an eight week class was actually accelerated. This schedule is what I was advised on to ensure the VA considered me a full time student but I suspect I could have enrolled in additional classes if I wanted to. I usually finish the week's work in 1-3 days and I'm going to be devoting my spare time to studying for the math placer so I can bypass trig and pre-calc.

I could wait a semester to apply to UT Austin for the fall instead (Good grades and my info has been sent over from my admin). Should I wait or pursue this offer with UT Dallas? 

Some pros: 

- They are one of two schools in Texas that actually offer a cognitive science program, which give me an opportunity to touch the computational aspects of neuroscience without getting a second degree. 

- They have a strong research opportunities and endowments. Research is key for me and career goals!! 

- Dallas has many occupational opportunities

- The MS would allow me to have access to UT Southwestern medical center (ranks high in medical school) 

- I was worried about how I would get my masters and especially applying and this kind of alleviates the stress I have. 

- Having a BS and MS would give me a strong foundation when applying to PhD programs 

Some cons: 

- I am aware that UT Dallas is considered a depressing school and has little connection between the student body. However, I care less about this as my first priority is getting my degree and excelling academically. Ill actively find ways to make my experience enjoyable. 

- Ranking is relatively low compared to UT Austin and A&amp;M university (however, Id rather get my degree now rather than later)

- The program may not be worth considering as I could attend a higher institution if I wait a semester.

And trust me, they WILL find it, this guy aint slick at all, hell my mom found it easily when she came to visit.

I thought of reporting him, but I felt like that would be overboard, but if thats the only way to protect myself then so be it. Ive already told him about it, but he dont listen.

I had a midterm and I got a 16%, I know it's such a low score but the concepts seem so difficult and my professor is not helpful at all. He mumbles a lot when he teaches and doesn't explain the concepts properly. Everyone in that class seems to self study. I've seen many failed as well and a few passed with average grades. I study really hard yet I'm still failing.

I just don't know what to do. I can redeem my grades by acing my second midterm and my finals. The professor also gives the students a bunch of bonus quizzes but I'm still getting low grades in those quizzes.

I'm not sure what to do - should I drop that course, should I retake it, or should I just find someting else to major in.

I can give a preference between different residence halls, on campus apartments or a specific 21+ hall which houses mostly graduate students I think.

I want to make the most of my time in the US and experience the college life but sharing a room with someone is not something Ive ever done and isnt a thing in my home country, here everyone has their own bedroom. I also definitely am a social person but I also really appreciate a moment alone to unwind. My question is if you would recommend to opt for a single room or not.

Also there is a residence hall with mostly international students but I would really like to make some American friends and Im afraid that will be harder if I am in a dorm surrounded with other internationals. On the other hand I have no idea if it will be harder to make friends in a regular residence hall since Im only staying for one semester and I have no idea how opening American students are to foreigners (I should mention I speak English fluently without an accent and Im a blond white guy, so I probably wont look out of place).

For reference, I am enrolled in a Canadian university with five courses with OSAP funding (minus living expenses due to also being on ODSP).

Now, my university recommends each student have about 36 hours available each week to do any class sessions, assignments, readings, etc.

However, in my situation, I need to work about 30-40 hours per week to afford living expenses (rent, bills, etc.) and food. While keeping the industry broad (media/broadcasting), my work can sometimes consume up to 50 hours in a week, depending on what I need to do in said week. I also do Uber Eats about two days a week for a few hours so I can afford gas and more food.

I am severely struggling to keep up with the pace because I am physically tired and mentally drained every day. In turn, I am constantly stressed out to the point where I can't focus on anything school-related; I am always thinking about my partner, being able to pay bills, having to think about what my next job is, etc.

It's to the point where it's hard to even remember the end-goal: get a degree so I can get a job where I don't need to work for five-ten different groups just to make enough money to break even on the month.

However, to get a better job, you need a degree. To get the degree, you need to quit enough jobs to free up time to do it. To pay for said degree, you need to work to be able to afford food/rent/etc. To be able to afford to take the degree, you need to work.

Dont get me wrong its a great school academically and large student body, but I just feel at a loss.

But honestly I wish I had gone there more, or gone to my flagship college which I dont know why I didnt apply, I think imposter syndrome and I thought I was dumb  and didnt have the grades.

I thought economics would be a good choice because their are so many different industries/job opportunities i can go into in case my original plan doesnt end up working out the way I want it to, which i thought was great for someone like me whos indecisive and changes my mind a lot. I also didnt mind math too much.

However, i have no interest in most of my classes. They just feel so dull and lifeless. The actual idea of the classes feels great (for example, I have a class where we talk about the Global Trading system), but theres so much math and graphing and so little discussion and writing, which i thought their would be more of. I felt this way in first year too, but I was having a lot of trouble adjusting to university in general, and since I have ADHD, i basically procrastinate everything. So, i just figured that once I managed to get the hang of things more, Id start enjoying my classes. That still hasnt happened though. I still cant manage my time/classes. I have so much difficulty studying for anything because I just dont understand the math involved, nor do I want to learn any of it. Im sure part of it is because I havent been able to manage my time and get my shit together, but maybe part of it is also the fact that this degree isnt meant for me? I honestly dont know. I was thinking that maybe I could switch to Political Science  since I took a class last semester and actually really enjoyed it, but the job prospects in that field are basically obsolete. Also, the degree kind of makes me feel morally corrupt, although this may be because a lot of the students in my classes are finance/business bros lol.

I just have no clue whether or not I should switch to Poli Sci or just stick it out and continue with Econ and hope that I get a job in the industry Im interested in. I like that Econ has a lot of job opportunities, because I obviously dont want to be broke in the future, but I dont know.

2023-11-11,1699731684,GPA and Serious Health Conditions,"During the summer before my sophomore year, I began having seizures; I had never had them before, and they just suddenly began. I was told that if it only happens one or two times, there cannot be an official diagnosis of a condition because it could just be a one-off thing. So for most of my sophomore year, I wasn't on any medications and had migraines almost weekly. By the end of the first semester, I had another, but I still was not put on medication until the end of the second semester. The side effects of this medication were extremely severe. If you know anything about epilepsy medications, you know that the side effects are always dizziness, drowsiness, and sleepiness, among others; in other words, pretty much everything that would result from the synapses in your brain slowing down significantly (and to below normal levels). I could not get out of bed without passing out or falling down, and I had no energy to do anything other than go to the bathroom. I was physically and mentally debilitated and immobile. The same thing continued through my junior year, and despite wanting to stop taking the medication, I was told that I had to. I still had two breakthrough seizures, though. By December of my junior year, I had not switched neurologists and the one I was seeing was still having me take the debilitating medication. I only began taking a ""better"" medication during April of my junior year when I got a new doctor. The medication doesnt help with the migraines though, so Ive been dealing with them since the beginning of my sophomore year.

I feel like this goes without saying, but this obviously affected my ability to get my work done. As a result, my grades during my sophomore and junior years were not great, or at least not up to the standards to which I hold myself (I had mostly good grades but very suboptimal ones sprinkled around). So my health completely trampled my GPA. As a senior now, I feel really defeated; I feel like my options post-grad are ruined, whether it be my career or grad school in the future. My school has put notes on my transcript that explain the lower grades (apparently that is something they can do), but still, I feel hopeless and as though my GPA does not reflect my full potential. I may sound like a snob to say this, but by normal standards, my GPA isn't ""horrible""; it's just not at the standard that I expect of myself.

Anyway, I guess I'm posting in this subreddit for some advice or counsel of sorts. No college experience is easy, but mine has been abnormally difficult. I have gone through a lot and had to persevere through a serious challenge I would not wish upon anyone: an epilepsy diagnosis. Even knowing this and knowing that the events and overall situation were not my fault, I still feel ashamed and poorly of myself.

I started out as an agricultural engineering major but later found out the difficult math and science classes weren't for me. I couldn't focus, I couldn't find any interest whatsoever in what I was doing, so I changed majors to IT because I couldn't think of anything else I would want to do. It was more or less a quick decision. And it's basically been the same thing. The courses are very difficult and I simply can't wrap my head around some of the concepts as well as finding an interest in what I am doing. I keep telling myself ""It's just because you are lazy"" and ""you're already this far might as well finish"" but I feel like I'm pushing against a mountain expecting it to move.

I can relate to this on so many levels. Relationships, careers, jobs, etc. I love working with my hands but at the same time i love science and I know I am smart, but I have no clue what I want to do with these traits. There are so many things I like to do that I can't choose anything and the two I have tried failed.

I have 6 courses (they are all mandatory). The semester has 13 weeks. Together, I have no less than 5 hours of lectures (not including tutorials) every single day. With tutorials, this can add up to 7. To add to that, we are given extremely complex and large group projects in languages we don't know, in frameworks we're not taught, and every week, there is at least 1 project to submit, usually two. These projects include not just code, but multipage (10+) documentation in LaTeX, and usually a presentation. These projects take  A LONG time to finish, they are just that hard. To add to that, we have very difficult tests almost every week since the foiurth week, there's usually at least two. I am not kidding, these tests are 1.5 hours to 3 hours long from topics such as Theoretical Informatics, Advanced Statistics, Parallel Programming and Distributed Systems, etc.

There were 250 of us at the beginning of the semester (7 weeks ago). 56 people have already dropped out due to the insane workload. There is no free time, we all work CONSTANTLY. Anyone with worse than perfect time management just doesn't make it.

The master takes two years.

2023-11-02,1698951960,Dropped out of 4 different colleges - is there no hope left for me?,"So here is the timeline of my educational disaster:

2016: I graduated high-school after having a terrible time mentally/socially. I only applied for one local school but due to burn out/lack of motivation/lack of discipline I dropped out but I never formally left the school which resulted in Fs across the board for my first semester. The school was local as well and my home life at the time was not good. To be honest I was pressured by my parents to go to college but I just was not ready at the time.

2017: I had been working retail consistently while not going to school - but issues with my mother reached a boiling point and my dad decided it would be a good idea for me to go away to college to get some space. I ended up thriving there for a semester and got good grades and I was hopeful. The space away from my mom really helped. However upon starting my second semester my dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. This destroyed me because my father was my best friend and we did everything together. Without a second thought I came back to my home to help with his illness.

2018: I was home and my dad kept getting worse - Im not going to get into how intense brain cancer is - but lets just say when they initially operated on his tumor - I lost my father on the operating table. He stayed on hospice care in our home and I wanted to make him happy. All he wanted was for me to go to college it was his dream. I decided to apply for a local community college. I wish I never made this choice because my mental state was not good. I barely attended class due to my dad being in and out of the hospital and ultimately being on hospice care. Once again this resulted in F grades due to lack of attendance.

2019: At this point my father had passed away. My whole family had to move and I was so lost. I wanted to make my dad up in heaven proud and I actually got a scholarship to a music program at a great college despite my bad grades. I thought this was my chance to finally complete school but then I found out the pandemic hit. All my music courses would be online. I tried to make it work but my home life with my mother made it impossible to focus. At this time I decided to completely give up on school.

Fast forward to today: I feel at this point Ive healed from all the dramatics and Im living on my own. Ive been working jobs but without a degree its hard. My dream is to become a nurse so I can help people like my dad when he was sick - but due to my bad grades the local community college says Im not likely to get in.

I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this and if so to what extent? Is this common?

I took 6 years off after high school and just f***** around drink and did absolutely nothing with my life in Florida. Fast forward a few years I met this girl up in Chicago and ended up moving up here with her and going to college at UIC. First semester I almost whipped it barely passing everything. Next semester I did slightly better in some classes and then completely failed one. Took a break over the summer to work on business and whatnot which I would have been able to focus more on but I had to go back to school and prep for that.
Now I'm living with my girlfriend in an apartment which requires me to spend even more time driving to the city driving back and working even more hours to cover the expenses, I'm in crippling debt, and I am going to probably fail every single class this semester.

I really just can't focus on studying or remember any information at all, It's all just a blur. Even if I study properly for the exam I go in feeling confident about getting at least a B and then end up with at best of 50%. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know if it's just that I'm not cut up for school or what but I really don't think I can do it. If I don't pass all my classes a semester I'm probably going to get kicked out of the campus, I doubt my girlfriend will stay with me and everybody I know and love will probably resent me for it.

2023-10-19,1697702327,Barely slept all semester because of suitemates,"Hi everyone, putting this out into the void hoping someone will give me meaningful advice on how to handle this situation.

To establish context, Im an RA in a suite style residence hall for upperclassmen. I have a single in a suite where theres also two sophomores in another room. These guys are complete shut ins. They are awake from 10 pm to 7 am gaming and yelling, go to sleep, then wake up at noon to go to their one class per day and then come back at 10 pm screaming and slamming doors. Theyre international students from China, so I get wanting to be on a schedule where you can talk to friends from back home. But this is ridiculous, and its clear they have no intention of compromising. I have attempted to ask them multiple times a week this semester (were in like week 9 now) and I either get no response (they seriously pretend like theyre not in the room while I stand outside knocking or just ignore me) or an okay, we will and it never lasts more than 20 minutes. I average about 4 hours of sleep a night because of this. This doesnt even begin to touch the fact they dont throw out their trash and leave it in the common area (mostly in front of my door).

We just signed our roommate agreements like last week which is absurd, but when I was facilitating the discussion I brought up when we all went to sleep. They said midnight (an obvious lie) and so I proceeded to ask how we want to handle ourselves after this time, and they said well whisper. I thought that was great! Theyre conscious theres an issue and willing to concede some things. Apparently not. Every night this week Ive had to continue knocking well into 4 am to attempt to quiet down, and every time I try to confront them during the day they wont open the door or say theyre busy. 

Tonight was my last straw. I have an 8 am tomorrow, and I knocked around 2 am. They ignored me as usual, but after about 5 minutes they paused heir game, slammed their door intentionally, and started yelling way louder than usual. Its about 4 am now and they still havent quieted down. They also said they would throw out their own trash during our roommate agreement session, but theres about 4 dominos pizza boxes in front of my door that have been there since Sunday and theyre not mine, among plenty of cans and water bottles.

I intend to bring this up to my superior tomorrow, but given my position I feel very messed up. I feel like I dont have control of my own living space much less relationships with these residents. We have our second round of mid semester check ins with our residents this week, but I cant conduct it with them given the current relationship. I cant cite them for being loud, nor am I sure thats a reasonable course of action. I cant be in my room when I need to sleep but I cant change my room. I dont think theyll ever want to move nor will they be responsive to any form of mediation; Ive tried and been ghosted so many times, plus I feel weird given Im supposed to be the mediator and cant seem to handle this. Im out of energy and its severely affecting my physical, mental, and social health, and academic health. 

If youve read my sad story so far thanks. I dont know what type of advice I expect, but its been nice talking to the void.

I am taking a class that is well known at my school for being a tough class. It is a law class that focuses on courtroom communication. Last week, for our midterm, each student had to complete a type up document where we summarized the facts of a presented legal case. I did relatively well on that [91/100]. 

After that, our professor required that we answer 4 additional questions, 300-500 words a piece, totaling 1,2002,000 words total. Far more than 'part 1' of the midterm. The tricky part is, in the assignment descriptions, the professor only included a vague statement and an equally vague question for us to answer. I sent multiple emails about requirements and got back equally vague answers. After multiple questions and little direction, I did my best. 

Today, I got back my scores and... they're really low. I have never done ""this bad"" in this class, and I am super bummed. I know that I am a competent writer ( I have worked really hard on the skill for 10+ years and have taken various courses to improve, etc). 

I want to ask my professor about my grades and if I can redo it, but I'm unsure how to. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to approach this?


**EDIT/UPDATE**

Thank you, everyone who responded. I reached out to the professor (using an example in the comments below. I highly appreciate the example). The professor expressed that everyone in the class did poorly on this aspect of the test. He is allowing everyone to redo the questions and made sure to include a rubric for guidance. He admitted that he intended for the questions to be vague, but upon review, he realized they were phrased poorly.

2023-11-12,1699792121,I feel extremely homesick after 2 years of studying,"I (20F) moved out of home two years ago to study in another city. It was perhaps also an escape because my boyfriend broke up with me after three years. The two years after moving were very exciting. I got to know a lot of people and went out a lot (for the first time in my life). Back then, I thought it was great to have older friends who knew their way around the city. They all worked in the fashion industry, which also impressed me.

Now, I've changed my studies, friendgroup and lifestyle. But when I look back now, it feels like I was just distracted for the last two years. I wasn't ready to move out at 18. But instead of realizing that, I did something every day. I thought it was fun at the time. But when I look back now, the people were not a good influence. Everyone was very superficial and we went techno partying every weekend. I didn't like techno before, and I still don't like it. But I thought it was part of arriving in the city and being cool. 

So I think that for two years I suppressed my real feelings and lived a life that didn't suit me.

Now I feel terrible. I have the feeling that I should have just stayed with my family for two years. I would have had a wonderful time there and it would have suited me better. I'm extremely homesick right now. I'm also sad that I've been living somewhere else for two years now and that I have to stay here for another three years to finish my degree. The thought of not living with my family for 5 years hurts me and at 23/24 I'm too old to move back home. 

Now I don't know what to do. The university I'm currently at is the best for my studies. But right now I just feel like moving back to my home town and studying the same thing there. My family is much more important to me than anything else. 

On the other hand, it feels like I've failed here and would lose another year of progress in my studies. 

What advice would you give me? And how can I deal with the feeling of having wasted two years with the wrong people and lifestyle. I just want to go back to my life with 17. Everything was perfect back then. I had the right friends, a loving family, a place I truly felt home &amp; loved, and a caring boyfriend. In this city I feel alone.",college,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17tj8yp/i_feel_extremely_homesick_after_2_years_of/

Ever since school I never had that perfect friend circle. I was usually a third wheel in most conversations and was never really appreciated but wanting friends too badly I never noticed the fact that I was surrounded with toxic people. Not giving any hate those people did make times bearable but I don't think I was that important to them as everyone else. When I was in high school I was going to an elite school where most the kids were from the royalty or the children of doctors, lawyers etc. I could go there because of my dad's hard earned savings. We are in upper middle class if you are wondering. I had a beat friend there although we got along she never wanted to hug me or even shake hands. I could put my hand on her shoulder etc and she would ditch me in lunch. But now I'm at this new college. With people of my mind set and I feel so much at home. These girls have made me happy and appreciated. The wait for me to pack my bags. Walk with me and include me. Today was a ceremony of our college. I recently took part in an essay competition and came first. When my name came up in the announcement no one else clapped other then the 12 girls whom I adore and they cheered so loud that I didn't need the other people to clap. I felt appreciated. Never before have I felt this way. They don't know know how much it meant to me. They tell me my smile is cute when I'm insecure about it and now I smile more. Moral of the story.

2023-10-17,1697503783,I dont know what to do anymore,"Hi this is my first time using reddit and i have no idea what im doing. 

Im in my 4th year of college and have changed my major 3 times and failed the last 4 semesters. Obviously the paths i set out on have not been working for me but no one at my community college is helping me. Even in high school no one would help me find my way i guess. No matter how many counselors i speak to no one will help me so im turning to reddit in desperation i guess. 

I started out as a general studies major but changed to an anthropology major which was not for me. I then switched to Computer Gaming and Simulation as my major. Every semester in my last two majors i have failed every class i have had. So clearly i need a different path but i dont know where to go. 

I love games (especially horror games) but that path didnt work out. 

I love special effects makeup and am pretty good at it (at least thats what im told i think im mediocre) but i dont even know how to do that as a profession. 

I love listening to true crime podcasts and recently ive been watching videos on the breakdown on criminal interrogations on youtube but where can that take me? My grandfather and father were morticians but I really dont think i could handle seeing a read dead body especially if it is a mruder victim and ESPECIALLY if that victim was a child or mentally handicapped. Same if i went down the path of criminal investigator, if the person im interrogating is a mruder of a child or me tally handicapped person i dont think i could be calm in their presence. 

I literally have no other hobbies or interests. Literally none. 

I used to want to be a special needs teacher, but then a special needs student at my school passed and it put into perspective how i could lose a child in that profession and it would hurt to much to deal with. Same with medical fields. 

I have never in my life had passions. I simply liked what i liked. I have never had a i was born to do this or this is my dream in my life. I didnt do well in school. I was more artsy but i never was passionate about any of the arts. I did to theatre (stage crew) for 7 years but that was to get student service hours. I didnt hate it but i didnt like it. And every extra curricular i did turned out to not be for me. Film studies? To technical and boring. Chorus? My voice is not at all good. Nutrition and fitness? Traumatizing (heavy-set girl in a class about health. Bullying central) child development? The classroom i interned in was to chaotic and i was having panic attacks. Government? Fck everything about gov. 

I literally dont know what to do with my life while every one of my friends is graduating and finding internships and jobs and starting their lives and im stuck. And im not comparing myself to them cause everyone goes at their own pace in life but i feel like im stagnant in life and just going through the motions making no progress. I feel so helpless and lost. I was diagnosed with depression but i feel that has nothing to do with it.

Can I get some advice on this? If I rewrite a definition but include the specific keywords and provide a citation for it, is this plagiarism? The academic guide and my dissert guide insisted that this was plagiarism and that I should have written it differently.

2023-10-23,1698082400,What should/can I do when professors dont offer office hours?,"Im currently a fully online student and am at a bit of a loss now. Some of my professors have been great, but others Ive really struggled with.

Im a tech major, and one of my courses this semester provides us with nothing but walls of text as the course content. Video lectures are non-existent, and were lucky if theres diagrams of any sort sprinkled throughout the text were provided. On top of this, they dont offer office hours which is my main gripe. This makes it extremely time consuming and difficult to navigate an assignment or learning objectives when I have consecutive and oftentimes highly technical questions that I need answered.

I plan on transferring to another university so I can attend in person, but Im worried the inconsistent format of my current program is going to set me up for failure given how difficult its been to retain information this way.

Has anyone experienced this and/or have tips for success given these circumstances? I have accommodations through the college due to a disability so Im wondering if this could be something I can approach them about as well? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

Ever since I started getting grade conscious in my senior highschool to sophmore years in college. I tend to always double check my answers in our exams to the point where it takes a lot of time which results in me being always the last to finish their exams. Let's say our first exam starts at 7:00 - 9:00 AM for one subject, most of my peers would finish at around 8:00 AM and I often take my time to finish around 8:50 AM or exactly 9:00 AM. 

In terms of time management. I am always fixated to finish it at exactly time given but our proctors (professors who watch us over the exams) sometimes would be impatient and take our papers if you're the only one answering which is my case. I'm just checking my answers back and forth while rewriting the missed parts and the proctor got mad because of it so I just rushed and hurriedly answered all of it. It was around 8:30 and the first exam ends at 9:00 sharp. I was able to finish but I wasn't confident enough about my answers.

Some proctors are considerate and they let me finish at ease without pressuring me and I understand that they also have another examination class to watch over and also do their actions like a quick snack, bathroom or water break but in my part as a student, I also have to assure that my answers were in fact correct because It is my responsibility to do my best and it is up to me if I were gonna pass or fail. So far, I've been getting decent to high grades and sometimes the highest or next to it.

We're both in this club that has weekly social events in addition to the typical club meetings.

It sounds pretty clearly to me like a sexual innuendo referring to autoerotic asphyxiation. And the fact that he's so much older than me, not someone my age, gives it a different feeling. But maybe he meant that when my roommate isn't home, I kill people? That would be pretty clearly a joke and I wouldn't have a problem.

(I also put this in r/advice and r/teenagers LOL I genuinely dont know what to do)

(this also happened yesterday, but its still on my mind)

I (18F) am the eldest daughter to two immigrants, living in California (so this is why Im asking for advice LOL) and I go to community college. 

For context, I just got hired to work at a daycare, and upon hire, they ask that you go get a basic physical checkup and provide results. The clinic I was assigned to go to has a very limited number of physicals they take on the daily, so I have to get up really early tomorrow if I want to make it before my deadline.

The issue is, Im in charge of taking care of my little sister (9F) and have to take her to school every morning. That includes getting her ready, feeding her breakfast, and driving her to school. But I fell behind and am only able to get up early enough to drive her to school. My father does the first half. Honestly, this is on me because I spend a lot of time during the night talking to my friends online instead of getting sleep to wake up early. 

So my mom and I planned what were going to do tomorrow: I take my little sister with me to the clinic and feed her breakfast, then just drop her off late.

When we told my father our plans at dinner, he got VERY angry.

When I left the house to go to rehearsal for the show Im in (I also do theatre), my mom called me and told me about how she and my dad had an argument about it and he started talking about how HES never included in my mom and Is plans, how HE always gets up early to feed and clothe my sister and how IM not doing my share of work.

This isnt new to me. When my fathers angry he will say the most insulting things ever, especially when its about me.

Im just so confused. When he asks me to focus on my studies, I do. He says do whatever you want, as long as you have an A. But it absolutely does not feel like that at all.

After two years of community college, I initially planned to transfer to San Francisco State University. But I absolutely cannot take this anymore.

This is the part where I need advice. My dad is very careful about finances, and hes always made saving money a big point for me ever since I was young. I want to transfer to SFSU as soon as possible. But if I move out now, I just know Ill feel such a big guilt and selfishness over leaving my family. Or feel as if Im leaving a financial dent because of tuition fees. My father doesnt say this, but my mother does all the time. They need me. Especially for my sister, whom I am also very close with. And when Im not there, what happens?

What do I do? Should I move out for my sake? Or do I stay longer for them?

TL;DR: I am the eldest daughter of immigrants and my father makes me feel worthless. But if I move out Ill feel guilty because of finances and because of my sister.

I finally went and enrolled at my community college. For the last few years I've wanted to, yet each year I came up with a reason not too. I submitted an application to start this year, then got promoted suddenly at work the next day. I didn't finish enrolling because I wanted to see what kind of workload I was going to be taking on.

 I've realized it's just more work inside the 40-50 hours at the office. I still have the same amount of time outside of work that I have had for the last few years. 

When I found out my company offers some tuition reimbursement, I decided no more excuses. I took a placement test and scored very well across the board, allowing me to bypass some of the entry classes.

Now, I'm reading everything I can on the balance of working full time and taking classes. I'm doing it all online. I'd like to not take 7-8 years to get a bachelor's degree, but I also know that taking four classes at a time on top of working full time might be a reach. 

My CC does have the accelerated 7 week classes for many of the courses. I fully get that it's the same amount of work in half the time. What I don't have a grasp on yet, is how much time/work is required for a class. I'd love to take two 7 week classes at a time to keep pace credit-wise, but am I going to drive myself insane doing so? I'm very good with time management, but is there enough actual time to manage?

2023-10-16,1697460365,Studying hard but getting average or below average grades,"Hey Redditors,  


I wanted to share my academic journey as a third year student and the persistent challenge I've been facing. No matter how hard I study, it seems like I always end up with average or lower grades.

At the every beginning of my college year, I'm highly motivated and dedicated. I put in much effort, but after a few disappointing grades, I find myself losing that motivation. This year, I thought I'd cracked the code by discovering my learning style: kinesthetic learning. I applied this during lectures and while studying at home, and everything seemed to be going great. I was grasping the material easily. 

But yet again, when it came to exams and assignments, I found myself in the same position - receiving poor grades. I'm at a loss now and not sure what to do next.

  
Has anyone else been through this cycle of highs and lows in their academic journey? How did you break free from it, and what strategies did you find helpful? I'd appreciate any advice or experiences you could share. I'm eager to turn things around. Thank You!",college,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17955vo/studying_hard_but_getting_average_or_below/

2023-11-02,1698932994,Dropped out and restarted several times. Can anyone relate?,"Hello everyone. I (23F) have been at college for quite a while now, and have been through several programs now. Here is a rough timeline:

* 2018 - 2019: Bachelor's English teaching. Did this for 1,5 years before deciding teaching ultimately wasn't for me.
* 2020: Bachelor's Pedagogy. Did this for a couple months because I had no idea what else to do. Got absolutely fed up with it after a few months.
* 2021 - 2023: Bachelor's Animal Management. Absolutely loved this, but had to drop out due to long-term illness in my second year.
* 2023 - now: Associate's Animal Management. Basically the two-year version of the bachelor's, but the level is much lower.

As you can gather, the bachelor's Animal Management was something I really loved doing. When I had to drop out, I chose to settle for the associate's version. That's something I really, really regret. This program is way too easy and doesn't really offer anything substantial compared to the bachelor's. I'm having quite a hard time adjusting to the much lower level and I'm thinking of switching back to a bachelor's again, likely Applied Biology. I then hope to be able to graduate some time at age 27 or 28.

Could anyone possibly relate to my situation? I don't think I've ever met someone who's switched courses as much as I have. It makes me feel pretty alone, since my peers have already graduated years ago and my classmates are only getting younger and younger.

2023-11-02,1698897524,I dislike my major and I don't know what to change it to,"I really hate my major.

Right now, I'm going into my second semester of sophomore year. I'm an accounting major right now. I initially chose accounting because that was the practical choice for me - my father's a CPA, so I have the connections I need, and it has pretty good job security and good pay. I'm pretty smart, as I've consistently gotten good grades throughout high school and even got admitted to an honors program when I applied to the school I'm currently in. I immediately got admitted to the accelerated 5-year master's program for a MAcc as well.

However, I've been reflecting, and I genuinely hate accounting. I hate it. I can't see myself doing it for the rest of my life. It's even evident in my grades, as I haven't been able to manage above a C+ for any accounting class yet. It's not my passion *(I've been gaslighting myself, saying, 'Who* ***really*** *likes* ***accounting****, anyways?' for the last year and a half)*, I don't do well; I'm struggling to understand everything, which causes more stress than anything else in my life. I've spoken to my parents, as they do pay for my college education, and although my mother is somewhat supportive, my father is angry with me for wanting to switch my major. If I choose something practical, he'll still pay for at least some of my education, but I know he will pull out financially at least a little, which I'm prepared for.

My biggest issue now is that I'm stuck on what I really want to do. I don't have any likes/dislikes/hobbies that would fit into a major (I love to crochet, watch TV, etc). I'm a people person for sure, and I want to have a job where I'm not just sitting at a desk all day, staring at numbers and creating balance sheets and income statements. I'm nervous to look at anything outside of business, as then most of my core classes I've taken already wouldn't count. But I don't feel like anything in the business school is for me.

Does anyone have any advice for this situation? I'm already a year and a half in, and I register for new classes on November 10th, which is 9 days from now. I'm terrified.

I also have my slightly easier courses this term. I'm honestly not sure when I'll ever get a semester like this again. 

But despite all of this i'm finding that I'm taking things WAY too lightly now and not rlly taking advantage of the free time the way I should be. I keep putting off things to the VERY last minute, I get this is a common issue amongst many students, but I've been doing it way more often. I've even turned in two assignments late (with a penalty ofc). And not only assignments, studying for exams has been terrible for me, consistently studying a day or two before the test is NOT something I'm proud of. 

I think I have this mentality that since I have so much free time I could just wait to do things later.. 

I want to be using my free time to study more and study ahead, to complete my assignments well in advance. And not even just academically speaking but joining clubs could be quite beneficial for me as well. I really feel like I could be achieving a lot this semester if I use my time wisely... but i'm not. There are literally students who have a tougher term than me and barely have any free and yet they seem to be doing better. I truly envy the students who have a strong foundation of time management skills that I clearly do not have.

2023-10-31,1698776319,I feel like an idiot,"Jokes on me for procrastinating till the last minute. Long story short, I have an online class that the instructor thought it would be a great idea to have a debate at the end of the year. Not my first time with the instructor, but last semester she was a lot more diligent in reminding us about the steps of the debate and whatnot. Something I need because I'm the type of person who forgets whether or not I took my medication. The instructions were posted at the beginning of the semester, I gave them a brief once over and then never looked again (mainly because I forgot they existed), and today the outline of the debate was due, which is the first time we had to turn in an outline. 

I didn't know about it until today when I looked in the weekly folder to see what was due, because she still has the due date being sometime in the summer, so it didn't pop up as ""due soon."" So, when I turned it in, it of course says ""Late."" No big deal, I can't control that. 

However, while I was working on the outline, I was rereading the instructions for the debate and saw a small section where it stated we were to inform her of our stance at the end of the second unit, four weeks ago. I had skipped over it the first time, and nowhere in the second unit did it state we were to inform her of our stance. She didn't even send out an email as a reminder as she had during last semester. I don't know if any of my classmates emailed her either. She didn't make any sort of note on any of the coursework I've turned in since then to remind me either. As far as I know, the email isn't graded, it was just for her to gain an understanding on our positioning on the debate. Regardless, I can't do anything about it now.

As I mentioned, I did the outline and turned it in. Not my best work, I forgot to include a conclusion like an idiot, but I did utilize my sources and whatnot. I use outlines as a general guide anyways, I don't typically state my intro, body, and conclusion on them word for word. SafeAssign of course flagged all of the sources on my References page as ""plagiarized,"" so my assignment report is sitting at a ""High Risk"". However, I know that those reports are bogus. The only thing I can do is sit and wait for her to grade it and accept whatever it is.

Regardless, I wish I could just rewind a week and actually put some effort into this assignment. I just feel like an idiot. Procrastinating isn't fun in the long run. I used to not be as much of a procrastinator, I don't know what happened, but now it's something so constant that it might as well be chronic.

2023-10-20,1697765946,I feel like a failure for still not being graduated.,"TW: mentions of ED

So, I'm 23 and I *still* haven't been able to graduate. I ended up taking two gap years due to Covid and extreme mental and physical health decline. I *hate* college with every fiber of my being.

While I was living on campus, the geniuses at my school built a food hall that failed fire code twice. How do you manage to fail more than once? Because of that the food quality when down I got incredibly sick. Like, eat a meal and then run to the bathroom to get sick 20 minutes later kind of sick. I ended up losing 15 pounds in 3 months. I wasn't the kind of person that had 15 pounds to lose, either. I got placed on the extremely underweight portion of the BMI, and only then did my university take notice.

This had lasting impacts on my stomach and my ability to eat food. I wouldn't eat unless I had to, and even then it was limiting in what I could eat - apples, bananas, spinach, maybe some meat here and there. My stomach would rebel and it was terrible. It took me a long time to get back to be able to see food as friendly and not dangerous.

Then once Covid hit, I dropped out. I was sick physically and then the mental illness kicked in. I was afraid to be alone sometimes. I've gotten a lot better, but my anxiety I was feeling made my stomach problems even worse (if that was possible). Eating would cause dry heaving sometimes, and I couldn't control it.

My family heard that I had dropped out, and that just wasn't what they wanted from me. So my grandparents made it their mission to make me want to go back. I understand why they did it, education got them out of literal poverty, so I respect their drive to want a better life for me. I was given a college fund by my great aunt, so my education is almost fully paid for. I still have to provide my own gas/groceries/insurance. I work full time in order to save for the things I want in life, my wedding and home I will have in the future. I'm also trying to set aside some extra money for retirement, but it's been difficult.

But right now my present kinda sucks. I hate my university for what they did to me. They fucked me up, could've killed me if it had spiraled into an ED (thankfully it didn't as far as I know, I have since been able to return to eating almost anything now, whoo). My best friend graduated on time last year and it's been eating at me. All my boyfriend's siblings are the same age as me and will graduate before me because they didn't have the same mental health struggles I did.

I'm stuck in school and everyone else I know isn't. They're off having fun at their careers, getting engaged, getting married and I just feel stuck having to do intro-level classes again. I won't graduate until I'm 24. Which pushes back a wedding date (I already have the boyfriend, he wants to wait to get engaged until I have degree in hand), which pushes back kids, which pushes the back the important, enjoyable, beautiful moments in life.

Because these moments don't feel that way. I feel traumatized and hungry and scared and anxious and I hate it.

I'm also going to school online, so I'm not really making any friends. Not that I made many friends when I was in person, either. So far this whole myth that college is supposed to be fun - or hell, I'd take ""tolerable"" at this point - just seems to far-fetched. All I want is to have them mail me my degree, take the postage out of the fund that pays the professors, and then send me on my merry way so I never have to step food on that campus ever again for as long as I live.

I'm pretty sure I sound entitled, but I don't care. This struggle isn't what I had envisioned. I just want to be healed, be better, be done with school and assignments and assignment anxiety so I can move onto things that matter in life, starting a family and creating a beautiful marriage.

I just want to hear from someone that I'm not crazy. That they would also be mad in my shoes. That life isn't all bad even if it feels that way. Maybe I just need to go touch some grass, idk.",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17bzkl2/i_feel_like_a_failure_for_still_not_being/

I was bussing tables at a fine dining establishment and all of the servers had to tip me out, so on really good nights and during the summer I was making more than the servers. I eventually quit because a new manager took over and she was really verbally and mentally abusive and would constantly change my hours without my approval, forcing me to skip classes, and overall tainted the work culture of the restaurant making it a miserable place to work.

I was there for 2 1/2  years but after that I job hopped a lot because it was the only way I knew how to maximize my earnings to keep up with the cost of living. Trying to not be homeless AND keep my grades up was a really traumatic experience that I don't want to experience again and I think that's the main reason why I'm dragging my feet going back to school. I graduated in the summer of 2020.

But now I want to go back for my masters but I can't understand how people fund their lives while studying full time. I'd either have to work part time and study full time or study part time and work full time.  Right now I work 8 hours 5 days a week and that would just be impossible to do if I were to enroll in a masters program. I also get good benefits for working full time at my job too which I don't want to give up but I'd be willing to let that go if I could somehow qualify for medicaid again like I did in my undergrad.

I'm a software engineering student and in semester 3. I failed a ""practice OOP"" class. Basically, you go to the class, program, when you are done you submit your work so the professor can tell you to change the code. You need 750 points to pass. But I'm very scared and shy so I do all the projects without submitting anything. By the end of the semester, I got more than enough, worked up my courage and submit all of them. But she said it's too late and there won't be enough time to reviews all of them. So, I'll have to redo the class next semester.  

P/S: At first we heard she was a tester so she'll test all of the input cases and she didn't want any input bug. But moving towards the end she didn't even bother to check the input and she would rather ask us to add new features or change them. Despite this, I'm really annoyed when I don't validate the inputs so 90% of the time i spent testing and checking my program.

Seeking Perspectives,"So, I'm a 28-year-old Studio Art major attending a university in person for the first time after transferring from an online school. Recently, I've observed some behaviors among freshman students that have left me wondering, and I'd love to hear your perspectives on this. One of my professors said this years freshmen are odd, but...

Has anyone noticed a trend of increased immaturity among freshmen? In my experience, some students exhibit behaviors like using a baby voice with professors, whining, or ignoring assignment instructions. There was a girl who fully lied down in the back of class. Some don't speak at all when asked about their process during critiques. (Maybe this is more of a confidence issue, idk) This observation has made me wonder if the shift from online to in-person education, especially in the wake of COVID-19, might be playing a role. 

I recognize that as someone a decade older than most freshmen, I'm supposed to be more mature, but this feels different. I also want to clarify that my intention isn't to be judgmental. I was bullied in high school and have always been friends with outcasts and weirdos, I'm genuinely curious and a bit surprised by these behaviors. Is it always like this? Would I have seen this if I went to college 10 years ago?

Could this be a reflection of the collective trauma from the pandemic? Or are there other factors at play? Im really interested in understanding different viewpoints on this matter, especially from those who have observed similar or contrasting behaviors.

I just got out of the airforce, applied to lockheed saying I would be graduating in December and said hey lets finish that degree quickly! As a way out of my crappy jobs and next to nothing in my bank account. And for context, I suck at math. But with my income literally being next to nothing and no real financial means of supporting myself at the moment other than low paying internships and no time to work, I threw myself into a do or die situation and decided to take 21 credit hours of all classes but one being math based. Im currently tip toeing the line of pass/fail in pretty much every class now. If I graduate it would be a miracle. Im behind on every class scraping by right now with either mid 70's or high-mid 60%'s as all my grades. (70% is passing). 

So I ask this, 1. What do I do in this situation, im behind on all my payments, my credit score is tanking, and I have virtually next to no money. 2. Im already spending majority if not 60% of my week doing homework, assignments, and studying scraping to catch up in my classes. 3. I have a future employer who has offered me a very nice career and they have waited for me due to airforce clearances. 

So every aspect of my life is currently crumbling and I bet all my chips on school and even that isn't working as I am 60% sure to fail at least one class and be unable to graduate until next May. Do I drop some school time and focus on work to get my financial life back in order? Do I study more and sacrifice more money making time to graduate? What would you guys do?

However, I feel like I missed my starting opportunity to catch on, to start studying in the appropriate way. I feel like that due to my first mismanagement I now won't be able to relate to anything that is being presented on the lectures - and this is based on facts, as I honestly do not understand anything that is being presented, and If I do, I do not understand it in the way where I can relate it to the topic as a whole.   
It also seems that I am the only one that does not understand, I am a bit afraid to ask questions as they may seem stupid.

I study a STEM school in Europe, my first semester consists of mainly mathematics \[ Linear Algebra, Mathematical Analysis and Logic , and others.. \]. I must have misunderstand Linear Algebra, and now I am slowly advancing but I feel like I am constantly catching up. The same is with Mathematical Analysis and Logic, or rather everything. I really love mathematics, and I did not have a problem in High School with it. I feel extremely useless as a student and that I may not be able to achieve my goals... everyone around me acts incredibly smart, they act adultly , and mainly responsibly. I do not feel that I am acting that way.  


In addition I have very little time to revise during the week after school , or learn, and I feel that if I learn, I learn slow, or too little to be of great convenience.   

I am losing myself in the world of distractions and tries of studies.

I used to want to pursue marine biology but got stuck at a state college in the middle of the city( non coastal) so I am taking the required courses for Biology major, but even then am questioning if I am just wasting my time. Its too late for me to just start over and even then start over as what?

Ive reached a point every single semester where I do horribly mentally because of just everything with life, work, assignments and grades, social life , etc. Things everyone has to deal with, Tim not a unique case I know. Which is what pushes me to keep it up- knowing Im doing better than some people. Im doing fine mentally this semester but I think it is in part due to the fact that Im not fully invested in my classes.  If I fail my classes this semester I might just take the next semester off.

Main issue is sense of self and self sufficiency. How am I going to find a stable job if I dont know what I want to do, what careers are even out there, etc. We spend all our lives going to school so we can then Spend the rest of it working.

Has anyone else experienced this and how did you recover?,"(20M) As the title suggests, I absolutely bombed my first semester at a local college. I got a late start to college because I wanted to save up and experience different industries before committing to a university. After working full time for a few years I decided I should go to a local CC so I could at least knock my generals out of the way and major in something business related, (business admin, finance, or accounting, etc..)

January 2023, I started studying for the SAT to remove holds on my application, and I took the exam March 11th. I scored a 1200. Not too shabby considering my 3.3GPA in high-school. I registered for my classes as soon as I could and I was set! I was so hopeful and excited for college but in hindsight, I wasn't even remotely prepared. COVID screwed up my last two years of high-school and my attention span/studying skills left much to be desired.

On top of a struggling junior/senior year, I took 5 classes which is exorbitant for a first time student who also works 30+ hours/week. I did cut work days and a class but it didn't seem to matter much. I was so overwhelmed, in some cases for no reason at all. My assignments were turned in, I was showing up to class and yet it was like my brain short-circuited. I couldn't focus or retain a damn thing, I hardly ate or slept for the few short weeks I was in college and my anxiety was crippling. It's completely pathetic, I'm literally a grown ass man who couldn't handle some gen ed classes. 

I dropped all of my classes on census day, closed my computer and cried myself to sleep. The silver lining is my transcripts are fine, no F's or W's. The bad news is I'm still in a depressive rut and have no idea how to go about recovering and preparing for what comes next.

TLDR : I have very high expectations for myself, created mental blockade, professor said data looks great and we can look at it together. I started tearing up because I thought he'd be disappointed in me. 



I just went to see my professor about a ""work experience"" class I have to do for my bachelor's. I chose this particular professor because he's very understanding and positive, he's also in the field i see myself working in in the next few years. The assignment was supposed to be for 6 to 8 weeks, however there is no time limit put on when it needs to be graded. It consisted of me gathering data and writing a protocol about it. The protocol part is what gets me really badly. 

I've been in the fields every day collecting data, even when the weather was bad. I wrote the introduction, why the plant is such a good model system for the phenomenon I'm researching, wrote down my hypotheses and started on the discussion based on what I learned from associated papers. However, I'm struggling with explaining my own data. I know it sounds stupid as hell and some of you are probably sitting here, reading this while doing your PhD and thinking ""damn bro you're stupid"", and I get it. I'm trying to make a perfect protocol for something that can never be perfect and there is no perfect and idk what's wrong with me.  

I took my sweet time with it and to be fair, I don't think other professors would have been so lenient with me. I wrote different exams and I went to work, pushing the ""protocol writing part"" further and further back. Now the guild hit me in the throat and I just keep having blockades. Thoughts like ""damn you took a lot of time to write a couple of pages now didn't you?"" And ""lol you do x and y instead of your damn protocol, you lazy cow."" 

I did go and see the professor and showed him my data and he said it's really good repeatedly, but for the life of me I don't know how to make any charts or if any of it it's even important?? Or does it even matter? I'm so scared of putting unimportant data in my protocol and failing, although I damn well know this professor would at least tell me something is wrong before letting me fail. Technically there is no chance of me failing, and even if I do, I can always redo it. So I don't really know what's wrong with me. 

Today I went to see him and I told him that everything is basically written out,however I am stuck at results. He said the data is great and we can just take a look at it together. I expected disappointment but all he showed me was empathy and understanding towards my situation. I started tearing up while he was talking to me about it and I feel really embarrassed about it, especially because there was another professor in the room, however he didn't say anything to me or about it. I'm supposed to defend my thesis to these two professors sometime next year and I feel like I fumbled and acted like a child, but the guild has been eating at my bones for a while now and feeling this release, hearing that all is OKAY and I don't need to worry about it so much felt so good. 

I always try to keep a cool head and keep my composure and resolve as much as I can, so you can imagine how embarrassed I feel right now, although no one judged me, not even a little. I just hope they don't secretly think less of me for stumbling over such a small stone.",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17khv0m/teared_up_in_front_of_my_professor_when_talking/

2023-11-04,1699114798,transcript hell,"Has anyone ever ran into this quandary? Back in 2005, when I was like 23, I applied to a community college for classes. I was accepted, paid the tuition, registered for classes and then like a week before classes started, had a change of heart and decided to move out of the state. I officially withdrew, got all my money back, and moved on with life. 

Since then, like, maybe 2010ish I had gone to college in another state, graduated, worked for a whole decade and then decided I wanted to go to nursing school. I applied to nursing school, sent only my transcripts from the school I went into 2010 and one other community college I went to, got accepted and then graduated from nursing school in 2022 w/ an associates. 

I just decided in the last month to go further w/ the nursing degree and applied for a BSN, which is basically just a bachelors in nursing. Applied w/ the info from my nursing school and my other college from 2010.

A few days passed and Ive been following my application status and see they got all my transcripts, and then get an email from them asking for transcripts from the 2005 school that i enrolled to but never actually attended. Honestly I had completely forgotten about it, it was almost 20 years ago.

So I thought no big deal, called up that school, went thru a phone menu from hell and ultimately got thru to what definitely sounded like an outsourced 3rd party customer service line. They referred me to Parchment, which I did go to. Filled out the info and sent it in. A day goes by and Parchment emails me with an automated message and tells me there is no record of me at this school. 

I called back, went thru the whole call menu fiasco again and tried to explain the situation again to another person, who just pushed me back onto Parchment. I reiterated my scenario again, and I hear her click a few keys, and then basically tells me to thru Parchment again.

At a loss, I just hung up, looked up an email address for the school and send in this long winded email explaining the situation again. I get a reply an hour later telling me to call the same number I had called before and reference a ticket number. I did just that, and then basically get the same response as I had the previous two times: Submit a request thru Parchment. 

Im assuming since I completely withdrew before classes started, I dont even show up as having a W and therefore a transcript for me doesnt exist, but yet I appear to show up in whatever clearinghouse database that exists out there that colleges look at it. I just find it kind of funny the other handful of colleges I went to before never brought it up.

Obviously I plan on contacting my new and hopeful college on Monday to explain, but Im curious if this has ever happened to anyone before?

Like, I tried to Google this specific scenario and I yielded nothing similar to my dilemma. I was just wildly curious what the outcome was if this has ever happened to anyone else? 

Now I just feel wildly inconvenienced that I've already spent several hours working on resolving this and getting nowhere.

I think the grades are automatically put on Blackboard by the system after the exams are done and not manually inputted by the professor, which is why this is confusing me.

In addition to our rent, we get a utilities bill every month, which is around 250-300 dollars. The bill always gets sent to me because I was the one who took the initiative to set up the utilities account. I figured though its only fair that we split the bill since we both live in the apartment. Last month, when I got the first bill, I asked him for his half, and he said he would pay me as soon as he got his student loans. So I payed the bill in full myself with his promise that he would reimburse me for his half. One month later, after me asking him for his half, still nothing. We just got our second utilities bill and I asked him again and got this same response, which was a nonchalant, Oh yeah, Ill get the money to you as soon as I can. At this point, I know hes not paying be because he doesnt have the money, as our states student loans have all been given out, plus his parents send him money for rent, groceries, weed, etc. I know hes just stalling because he doesnt want to give his fair share.

I'm double majoring in 2 different fields of humanities. A lot of my fellow students have called my degrees useless, if not, some of my friends have poked fun at me for how I won't get a job after I graduate because of my degrees. I asked a lot of the Trustees what they majored in, and a huge amount of them majored in the humanities. These people, who are CFOs, who are CEOs, who are Lawyers, and Senators, and even more! They were all interested in my field of study, and helped gave me tips for how to apply to jobs with my degrees. They were glad that the student representative for this year finally wasn't a business major. They would tell me about the value of humanities degrees, and everything that you can do because of them.

It is the first semester of my freshmen year of college, and I have realised something critical. I didnt want to go to college in the first place. The only reason I went was because my parents said it was a good idea.

Keep in mind, my parents did NOT force me to go. I was just afraid to do what I wanted with my life, and this was just what they suggested.

When I was younger, my dad also said that if you dont go to college, Ill kick your ass so hard that youll never be able to sit down again.

Instead, I actually wanted to go into some sort of trade program to learn a skill, rather than attending the local university.

I feel pretty guilty because my parents already paid for my semester bill, and if I dropped out, I would just be burning their cash.

Let alone the growing fear that with every extra symptom, the infection is possibly spreading and its so close to my brain. 
I am extremely poor, work fulltime to pay for rent, Im in school via financial assistance and scholarships. I just had to drop one of my favorite classes because I knew he was going to fail me from attendance. 
Im scared. I dont know what to do.
Im scared for my health. Im scared to lose all the hard work Ive put into this semester. Im scared to lose my scholarships and financial assistance. And I have no one.

If confused: we dont know my diagnosis truly.

Ideally I would want them to empathize with the current state of the economy and understand that if I could get the medical care I needed (aka afford it), along with afford school and housing on top of it, this situation wouldnt be so dragged out and horrible. I want them to see that I care so much about my education but its not practical to be in class if I will just be sitting there dissassociating bc of oral pain.

No, I'm not deathly afraid of leaving home or have some deep seated fear for me to psychoanalyze. 

But all the hype in high school (and, frankly, in community college to an extent) about getting away from my kinda rural area and going all across the state, or to different states? I just didn't get that. I feel for those with a toxic home life and that's why they're motivated to get out of the area, but I just didn't get that culture. I also understand if someone gets a big scholarship to go elsewhere. My brother, who is in hs, is also hyped about it, and I just..don't get it. (I'm not trying to make generalizations about the culture, this was simply the culture I personally experienced and I'm aware it can be vastly different elsewhere.)

I am simply...perfectly happy in the area that I live in. Do I have dreams of eventually going out of the area? Sure, but I want to have a solid career foundation first, and for my area of interest (nursing), I need college to do that. So, at least for now...I am just happy where I'm at. I'm safe, I'm well cared for, I have all of my needs and wants met, there are plenty of opportunities here for my major, and besides for capitalist America being capitalist America (live in the states whoops sorry for not saying that earlier), I am just...completely happy where I am at. 

Call me complacent, call me unambitious, I don't care. What if I don't want to ""stake it in the big city"" when I'm perfectly happy where I am?

As someone who didnt use my desk, I decided to give this roommate my study light and my comfortable chair. But when I had to use a desk for an interview, I asked to use his desk. He said yes at first, but then he started to ask me questions like why I couldnt use mine. Uh because my chair and light is at yours? He asked more questions, so I got annoyed and just said never mind Ill use my desk, dont worry about it. Then hes like why never mind? Im just asking wondering. So I took my chair and light back and had my interview at my desk.

The roommate is fucking inconsiderate. Including the lethal amounts of him vaping and smoking cigarettes which makes the apartment smell, after the desk situation, I was about to take a nap, blinds are closed, door is closed. The fucking dude come angry asf stomping in the room. He opens the door, the blinds, then he FUCKING LEAVES THE ROOM WITH THE BLINDS OPEN AND DOOR OPEN. It was definitely done in purpose and that set me off the most.

After what he did when I was trying take a nap and the whole desk thing, we stopped talking to each other. Then one day, I walk in my room and hes just dead looking my in the eyes. Like he wanted to kill me or something. What did I even do? I resolved the situation with the desk, so what are you mad about. He looked for so long and I had to ask him whats wrong. The mf didnt even say anything and walked out. 

Him and my other roommates are cool with him, which is fine. After all the shit hes done, I cant stand to hear his voice or be in the same room as him. I do want to hang out with the other roommates, but its a mutual thing where me and the roommate dont want to talk, so if we were to hang out with the other two roommates, the vibes will be weird for everyone.

A couple hours ago, they went out to play basketball and I didnt get an invite, so Im pretty bummed about. They dont know we arent speaking to each other, but it lowkey hurt I didnt even get asked. So I guess this post is about what should I do? I dont necessarily want to be cool with him again especially after the whole desk and nap thing, but now I feel excluded by my other roommates which is my fault I guess for not wanting to be around this guy.

Im a 1st year in college and have really been enjoying it for far. However, I have recently been offered a job that would last a week but pay incredibly well in my hometown. My home is 5 hours away from my school so it is far too long to commute, but looking at the syllabus, it seems like the classes I would be missing would be fairly calm days (meaning either time to work on projects or in-class discussions, which I have participated in a lot and am consistently understanding the material for).

Im undecided if I should skip school for this job opportunity or just pass it up, and Im wondering if it would be rude/disrespectful/out of line to ask my professors what I would be missing/how important the classes on those days are. 
A little more context- I go to a very academically rigorous college but have been keeping up in all of my classes so far and I think my professors generally see me as a very responsible and engaged student, so I dont think they would assume Id be skipping just for the sake of it.

2023-10-14,1697299931,My roommate is accusing me of bullying after confronting her about using my clothes and uncleanliness.,"You might have seen a different perspective of this story already (linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1776ry4/my_roommate_is_telling_people_i_bullied_her_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) but I am the person whose belongings this roommate has been stealing from and this is my perspective. This is definitely going to be a long story so bear with me.  I am a senior in college, and was randomly assigned 3 roommates to share an apartment with.  Upon meeting them, we all got along pretty well.  We talked every day, asked each other for advice, and generally were good friends.  This was until 4 weeks ago.

4 weeks ago, my concealer went missing after pregaming and getting ready with my 3 roommates.  I didn't think anything of it, and assumed I was the person who misplaced it.  After this day, I noticed one of the roommates, we can call her Ally, that I do not share a bathroom with would go into my bathroom every single morning.  Me and the person I share a room with (let's call her Jenny)  both noticed, as the door is loud, and wakes up me, her and my dog.  This went on for over two weeks before I brought it up with Jenny.  She said it annoyed her as well, especially because it was at 7 AM, a time that no one in my room is awake.  We noticed Ally would be in our bathroom (which is connected to our closet) for at least 10 minutes daily.  Me and Jenny never understood why she would go in there because she has her own bathroom, and has no personal belongings in our space.  During this time, I was unable to locate a pair of leggings after a day that she went into my bathroom/closet.   I still assumed that I had misplaced them and was concerned, but not of stealing. That weekend, I went to my hometown, and took a suitcase.  When I got back to school on Monday, I was too lazy to unpack my suitcase and it remained in my room until Thursday.  When I opened my suitcase, I found my leggings which could only be possible if someone had put them there. Jenny with helped me look for the leggings before I left for over an hour and knew I was unable to find them before leaving the previous weekend.  It was at this point I addressed my concerns with Jenny.

I am going to list all of the concerns I discussed with Jenny:

* My concealer was missing. (I am a woman of color and the only other person who could have worn it was Alli)
* My leggings, that I wear at least once a week because I exercise, had gone missing (me and Ally are the same size and height)
* While I was away, I asked Jenny to remove my clothes from the dryer and she was unable to find them until the following day
* Over 10 different clothing items have deodorant stains on them.  This may not sound odd, but these were clothes that were clean and had not been worn by me in at least 2 weeks.  There were a number of sweat stains and smells coming from clothes I know I had not touched in weeks and even months.  THE CLOTHES SMELLED, and not like myself or detergent.

Once telling Jenny, we decided to tell the third roommate, Angie, who had her own issues with Alli.  Angie then told us about how Alli had been leaving panties with blood and excrement stains in their bathroom.  She had left bloody towels, hair, and just general trash everywhere. She then told me that she suspected Alli was using her face products as well.  Angie told me to check the rest of my belongings. It was at this point I noticed that most of my makeup was either broken or used, which is also odd because I have not used any foundation or makeup products aside from concealer and mascara for over 6 months.

We decided to confront Ally.  She did not deny anything immediately. She only stated ""I can't believe this"" for nearly 10 minutes before saying she didn't know what I was talking about. She even suggested a 6 foot man had been coming on to try my size XXS skims dresses while we were all gone. After this, she quite literally started throwing a tantrum.  She was yelling, screaming, and was offended that we had accused her of being a kleptomaniac. We all found this strange as we had never even used the word stealing. (We have since found out that she actually takes medication for kleptomania.) After this conversation, I informed an RA (who ended up being quite unhelpful and has a student conduct report for racism).   She stopped sleeping here, and told us she was moving out.  After a lot of emails, and weeks of her lies, she has finally started the move out process.

This has not been the end of Ally though, she has brought between 2-6 ""friends"" into our apartment at any given time to help her move out.  They hardly (if at all help) and become extremely argumentative with my other roommates and I.  It has gotten to the point where we can expect some form of harassment/confrontation daily.  She has told them that I am a bully, and a liar, when that is simply not the case.  I am offended that someone would even say that about me, especially without mentioning all of her absurd behavior during this time.  Does anyone have any advice?

TLDR: my diagnosed kleptomaniac roommate has been using my belongings behind my back and ever since we've confronted her about it, she's gone on to tell everyone that we basically bullied her out of our apartment to move out.",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/177sz22/my_roommate_is_accusing_me_of_bullying_after/

They're starting us freshmen off with super easy classes, and people are losing their mind over 5 page double spaced essays that they have two + months to complete. like having sobbing nervous breakdowns because it's ""too much work???""

For more context, I came from the NOVA area school system. Also, any pointers for what I can do to help these people? I don't want to do their work for them, but maybe some advice would help?

2023-11-10,1699660007,How do I convince my parents to let me major what I want to?,I am currently a freshman in college studying Business Administration. While I like I do not see myself doing it for 40+ years. I dont feel extremely passionate about it. I have always wanted to be an airline pilot since I went on my first flight when I was five years old. Aviation is something I feel very passionate about and I feel like I would be able to perform my job as a pilot better then me being in management at an office building. My parents say that I do not have the personality to be a pilot and that I am to anxious. I have anxiety which I am able to control when I go to the gym and eat healthy. It is extremely manageable for me. My plan is to major in Aviation in the professional pilot track and I want to minor in Business administration. The business administration plan is my backup plan in case Aviation doesnt end up working out for me. I do know that before I end up flying for a major like United or American I have to start out as a flight instructor and a regional pilot but I am okay with that since it is something I am passionate about. I also plan on getting my real estate license and do that on the side along with flying.

2023-10-30,1698690077,Most of us wouldn't be in college if it weren't to improve our job prospects.,"People say to go to trade school or not go to college if they don't want to learn and just want to get a job. To that I say, statistically speaking, college graduate are more likely to be hired for jobs and have a higher lifetime net worth which makes a college degree a good return on investment. This is because a majority of good paying jobs are gatekept by a college degree.  So it incentivizes people to get a degree for the sake of improving their job prospects. The reality is that most people don't go to college just because we care about learning. I think it's somewhat out of touch when people just say ""don't go to college"" in response to people who say they just want that piece of paper for a job and don't really care much about learning. Say that to everyone in the U.S who is going to college. You really think a majority of them want to spend so much money and time just because they like learning? Not to mention the fact that a U.S degree requires gen ed of subjects which are not relevant to our major and may be uninteresting. If we just want to learn, the internet is a free resource,  and we would not be spending tens of thousands of dollars and go in debt simply to *learn*.

I know people are going to counter this argument and say that a college degree in the U.S has benefits which is that it makes you more well rounded, intelligent, and whatnot. but is a majority of what we learn in college actually necessary for a job? nope. while the skills you learned in college can help in the job, a majority of jobs don't require skills beyond a highschool level education with the exception of certain professions like being a lawyer or a doctor where direct knowledge from your education matters. Going back to what I said, it is not worth spending tens of thousands of dollars just to become a smarter person.

Most of us go to college because it's a series of hoops we have to jump through so we can improve our job prospects in life. College for many people is just a means to an end.

2023-11-11,1699684552,Need to confirm if im the crazy one or not (bad roommate?),"So. I'm turning to you all because I dont know what counts as bad roommate or not at this point.

I've been incredibly patient, ""kind"" as to not make conflict, explain reasons and ask kindly, and always greet my roomie when she returns. 

Here's a small list of things I've collected, which she does. I've never had a roommate before,  and I want to make sure these reasons are all valid and ""common sense"" enough to hopefully confront:

1. Banging the door when im asleep, especially at night (1am&lt;). Told her multiple times, she never does it. 
2. Switching the ceilings lights on whenever she wants when im sleeping, morning or night. 
3.  Never switching off her desk lamps, and they end up blaring into my face at night. I have to get up, switch it off, and go back to sleep cause she's lofted her bed high, and is ""too lazy"" to come down to switch it off.
4. Plays games at 1am&lt; in our room, where she gets fired up, curses/shouts loudly, aggressive loud clicking. 
5. Videocalls friends 1am&lt; without headphones. I have to tell her to wear them, and then she asks me why. And i have to argue before she begrudgingly does so. 
6. Anytime one of these things inconveniences me, i tell her, and she glares at me in SILENCE, and then does so with a big sigh and attitude. Not even a ""sure"","" no problem"" or ""ok"". 
7. Sleeps at 4am each night, which i dont mind, EXCEPT she is loud af with anything, including banging drawers, doors, etc. 
8. She sleeps with lights on, we had to compromise that she'd turn her night light her way to avoid it blaring into my face. Except she doesnt do that, and if i tell her, she just looks at me and continues her thing. 
9. Texting with system noise on max at night. Her texting clicks go on for hours at night until she sleeps on her ipad. 
10. She sleeps the entire day, and when i return to find her asleep, I believe i do my part and be as quiet as i can. Hence, when shes up the entire night, i want her to be considerate but she just doesnt care ig. 

I avoided going to the RA till now cause she told me that she's rather i say it to her, but its gotten to the point where i feel incredibly uncomfortable whenever i do. I even stay at the library until 12am every day because i feel more at peace there than in my own room.

2023-10-16,1697493403,Addiction in college: From a recovered addict in college,"Anyone who has seen a friend fall into addiction or lose themselves to the college party culture, i really hope that I can help you better understand how to help! 


Firstly, im 20 and a recovered addict(mainly benzos), I was a casual user in highschool, a functional addict the first semester of freshman year, and a shell of a person for 2 years. Ive been clean 6 ish months and have really worked on understanding why and how I ended up in such a bad place. Im sharing this here in hopes that someone can take what ive realized through recover and help their friend or roommate or partner start their recovery. Also huge disclaimer, this is my experience and things ive learned through research+therapy, it may be different for some people!


1:

The root of addiction is lack of connections, as people we all thrive when we are with people who care about us and working on things we care about. The biggest problem I had was social anxiety, I let myself take something so I would feel comfortable going out. In highschool I had friends who would make me feel comfortable in social situations, but at college I didnt. I found friends quickly, but they were not the best. I would get high before even hanging out with them 1 on 1 in an attempt to overlook the hurtful things they did. I had a large friend group, but I felt so completely alone so I numbed that. In numbing that, i numbed my desires, my feelings, my cares, and my need for reciprocation. 


All that to say, check in with your friends who are addicts, in a non judgmental, non solution focused way. Just listen to them. That makes more of a difference than you think. Even if you think you check in enough, make an effort to check in a little more. That can be what makes someone feel like they deserve to recover. 



2:

The situation gets out of hand so much quicker than the addict realizes. At first id get high 1-2 times a month, then 1-2 times a week, then everyday, then before i even got out of bed. I didnt think it was an addiction, i thought it was the college life. People would joke about me being a crackhead and i would joke about it too. That kept me in denial longer than I want to admit. 


Please dont engage with jokes about the status of someones addiction. You can hee hee and hur hur about funny stories while high, memories involving drugs, or your experience with certain drugs, but addiction should never be a joke. I didnt realize the jokes people made made were how they actually saw me until someone finally stopped laughing. 


3:


People always say addicts will get clean when they are ready and then cut off friends with addictions, obviously if your friend is stealing from you, hurting you, or a enabling your addiction please prioritize yourself, but if you have the capactiy to be real with them do it. I was never ready to recover, i would still be on drugs right now if I didnt have someone take the time to be real with me. You can be harsh, not hurtful, but telling them how they have let you down or been a bad friend can wake someone up. It probably wont be the first time, but stay strong in your stance. Call them on their shit. Be angry if they betray your trust. But under a blanket of support and love. 



It could really be as simple as 

Remember last weekend when we did x thing, you did (whatever they did), i didnt say anything then because you were high, but im really upset/hurt/embarrassed that you did that 

I really dont appreciate how you have been treating me. It seems like any time youre high you (insert hurtful behaviors). Im not mad at you, it just makes me feel like (how you feel)",college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/179hzen/addiction_in_college_from_a_recovered_addict_in/

2023-11-07,1699385082,Roommate is driving me and my other roommate crazy and I dont know what to do.,"So I (24F) am in college right now living in an on campus apartment. I have two roommates, lets call them A and B. A is a few years younger than me and a junior. B is older than both of us and shes a senior. A is autistic, and although she is very sweet, shes been causing a slew of problems with her inconsideration the entire semester. These are just a few examples: 

1) she does laundry from sun up to sun down almost every day. Thats not an exaggeration or a joke. For me its ok because I do my laundry once a week, but at the same time there are times I NEED to do laundry and shes got a load of clothes in there that wont be done for an hour. I know B is frustrated with this as well.

2) A takes out the trash when the trash isnt even close to full. At first it was fine but I bought trash bags and it feels like theyre being wasted. B has voiced her concerns about this as well. 

3) A can be very loud. Ill find that shes running up and down the hall when doing her laundry. There have been times that Im laying down to take a nap and I get woken up from all the noise. She goes home every weekend and when she comes back her parents come in and help her bring stuff in. They are very nice and I dont have a problem with them, but they are loud most of the time theyre here. 

All of this came to a head the other day. Her parents were in here helping her bring some stuff in, and B was in a meeting (Im guessing over zoom). I was laying down to take a nap and was nearly asleep when I heard B talking to A and it started getting a bit heated. I went out to see what was going on, and B was telling me what was happening. I tried to calm A down but she was so flustered and upset that I couldnt get through to her. When she gets upset she repeats the same things over and over. She usually just keeps saying shes sorry. Shes apologized to me multiple times about the other day even though Ive told her its fine. 

Another thing I didnt mention was that A has been walking around naked. I was leaving for class and I looked to my left as I was walking out the door, and A didnt have clothes on. I honestly dont want to see anyone naked, it just feels weird to me. Apparently a few days or a week or so after that, I heard B say something to A about putting in a towel. I asked B later what was going on and she said A was walking around naked in the hallway. She was checking on her laundry while she was naked. B said she told A to at least put a towel on, and A said sorry over and over and that was it. 

As I said above, B is very sweet, and Ive tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, since she is autistic. Ive tried to go easy on her because I also have a disability (mild cerebral palsy) and I know how it can feel having to work a bit harder to be better or do things right. But at this point, I am getting very very frustrated. Ive tried to talk to her and she just says ok and Im sorry over and over, but nothing changes. I dont know what to do.

I had a group during orientation but I had to leave lunch early one day and they never made an effort to include me since then. I joined clubs and talk to people in there, but none of them seem to be too enthusiastic to talk to me.

2023-10-15,1697383134,Is it normal for some people to never grow out of the 'Homesick first-year' Phase?,"I started my third year in August. I'm in a four-year undergraduate program so I'm in the second half of my college experience. I'm struggling a lot with homesickness right now, and I'm starting to feel like something is wrong with me, or that I'm somehow doing the college experience wrong. Here's some background:

The college I chose was the farthest one that I applied to- it happened to give me the best financial package and had a lot of great resources for my major. It's not terribly far away, but I only get to go home for breaks, more or less. It's about a 7-hour drive away and a 9-hour train ride. I don't have a car so I rely on the Amtrak to get home. Train tickets are not cheap so going home is a big financial strain.

My first year was very rough. I struggled to make friends and dealt with a lot of academic anxiety. On top of this, my dad and sister both had medical emergencies that year at different times so I was constantly stressed out over my family's health and just wanted to go home. The summer between my first and second year was heavenly.

My second year started much better. I had a more solidified friend group and went to concerts and day trips with them. I was more confident in my classes and was building good relationships with my professors. Fall semester was great, but even at its best, I still would have preferred being home. Then, in the Spring semester, I started to feel like the butt of every joke in my friend group. Not sure how the dynamic changed, but I voiced this to them and nothing really changed. They'd always make jokes about me with negative themes despite communicating that every now and then was fine, but constantly was starting to affect my self-esteem. They'd play it off as innocent fun and that I was getting worked up over nothing. I started to distance myself and felt more homesick than ever before until the summer came.

This year, I'm in a lot of classes with these same people. We're still 'friends', but I don't go out of my way to hang out with them anymore. I feel very isolated and alone. Every minute I'm here, I'd rather be home. When I'm home I'm so happy. I went back home a week ago for October break and I had to stop myself from crying all day on the last day that I was there. I absolutely hate being at college with every ounce of my being, but it's too late in my college career to transfer to another school and dropping out is certainly not an option with the amount of money I've already invested into my degree. I was hoping that I'd grow out of the 'Homesick' phase of college by now. As I mentioned, even at it's best, my college experience has always been plagued by homesickness. I've done everything in my power to make \*good\* friends, and nothing seems to stick. I've joined clubs, I had multiple jobs on campus, and I'm active in all of my classes, but I find it so hard to build those relationships that make it not awkward to ask if they want to hang out outside of class/club/work. I struggle with social anxiety too, which is definitely a huge factor in this. I keep in touch with my friends at home as much as possible, but it's hard when we're all going to different schools.

Has anyone else struggled with never-ending homesickness? I always miss my friends and family back home endlessly. Not a single friend I've made in college so far has actually made me feel loved and valued as my friends from high school do. I love my family so much and I miss living with them. I miss my pets so much as well. If anyone else has struggled with this well into their third or fourth year, how did you manage it? What can I do to get the most out of my college experience without my homesickness holding me back? I'm at the point where I don't even want to go home for breaks that are shorter than winter or summer because having to go back to college is too painful. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

Edit: Adding a 'TLDR' 'cause I forgot to:

2023-11-01,1698870355,Felt bad for my english professor today,"Its a mandatory academic writing course you have to take for the school. The idea being that we learn who to write essays on topics for future classes.

We wrote in person essays last week and they were descriptive essays. 

He opened class by saying that a lot of essays were lacking in description and many of them had used a lot of the same words/phrases and that its worrying for their futures when writing or expressing themselves in academia.

He asked if anyone ever read Orwells 1984 in the past. I have and apparently I was the only one.(Its a really good book, I recommend it)

He mentioned that a plot point in the story is about the idea of newspeak and what Orwell meant by it in the book. The idea that if a person is limited on the words they know, than they are limited in thought.

2023-11-04,1699095573,How to handle a roommate who appareantly hates me for seemingly no reason?,"It's been one and a half month since i've moved into a 3 person dorm room. They are both older than me and are former friends, enrolled in same year and are pretty close. In the first two weeks or so I tried to have conversations with them, knock on the door and say hi whenever i entered the room and stuff, basically things we would do with my former roommates. But i quickly realised even if they responded to me, they couldn't be bothered to do any of these and didn't seem to care when i did so i stopped as well. 

Even though i basically don't interact with either of them and can't study in the room because of the noise they make when they are both in the room and spend most of my time outside/library, especially one of them seem to can't stand me whenever i am present in the room? 

she keeps saying she cant sleep (not to me, to the other girl), she scuffs and pushes the blanket over the top of her head when im getting ready for an 8 am lecture (i only turn on my desk lamp and am walking on eggshells to not make noise). Meanwhile i wake up to her slamming the doors when she is the one who has a lecture early in the morning. She also asked me to turn off my desk lamp and study in the caffeteria the one night i didnt go to library (i was sick) because she had an exam tomorrow, and i had too. And guess what, i turned off MY fucking desk lamp and went downstairs.

The final straw that made me type out all of this was how terribly sick i was feeling yesterday evening when i got out of a lecture basically beaten up at 7 pm, found them both in a dark room one of them sleeping, the other one looking at her phone in bed and thought i could also get some sleep. They both ocasionally sleep daytime and i try to not make any noise and don't even turn on my desk lamp unless it is pitch dark. I sometimes just leave them alone and take myself out if i can. Yesterday was THE only day I went to bed early only for once and the very minute i put my head on the pillow after taking painkillers, one of them asked to turn on the blinding white leds at the ceiling, they both got up and started chit chatting real loud at the top of my bed. 

I was on the verge of tears trying to sleep under thw blanket until i finally asked that girl as sweetly as i could 'cant you just use your desk lamp or something?' she looked funnily at her friend one moment but then said fine without looking at me and got out of the room slamming the door on her way out before her friend finished the sentence ""are you seriously going out?"". i have never lived with people who showed so little sympathy towards me i felt horrible and pretended to sleep.

I dont think i can change my room anytime soon, the dorms in my uni are basically crammed and im really lucky to have found this room but this girl is driving me nuts. i feel so unwelcomed in my own room. do i try to talk to them about this and fail miserably or do i act like a bitch, how to deal with this?",college,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17nj8gd/how_to_handle_a_roommate_who_appareantly_hates_me/

Recently, shes assigned us a quiz covering concepts from lessons/homework for the FOLLOWING week. She said in a D2L email the day that the quiz was due that its been brought to my attention yada yada, Ill be extending the quiz deadline to the day before next weeks homework is due. 

Yesterday she gave us a module 4 test, that are explicitly meant to be over the modules they pertain to, and not collective.

I cant help but worry about how grad schools will see me when they see my GPA is mediocre from the Bs and Cs that my school hands out like As at another school. Its so frustrating and feels unfair. Maybe Im dumb but I didnt realize how much insanely higher the expectations would be at a competitive admissions school and I was under the impression that the environment would just feel more studious and people would care more than partying and skipping class.

2023-10-31,1698746780,Advice on professor?,"Im not sure how to approach this situation, and Im hoping you guys might be able to help me out. 

I have a professor in one of my classes who I have also worked under as an RA for about a year, so I see her quite often. Shes very kind, and I like her a lot. 

For some context, I am from Maine and going to school on the other side of the country. The recent mass shooting there took place close to where Im from and where my family is, and I have high school friends and classmates going to school in Lewiston. Its been hard to deal with, mainly because Im the only person from Maine anyone here knows and I keep getting asked about the shooting. Constantly. Its exhausting, and its REALLY not helping my mental health. 

Today at the beginning of class (theres only about ten of us students in there), my professor publicly asked how I was doing while reminding the class where I was from, and asked for details about the shooting and how I was dealing with it. I felt very put on the spot and did the whole Its been a bit difficult, but Im doing well shtick, and class proceeded as normal. Meanwhile, everyones gawking at me like Im some exotic zoo animal. The entire thing just made me ridiculously uncomfortable. 

I feel like I should bring this up with her, but my question is how should I do that? Shes both the researcher I work under and my professor, and shes an awesome person who I really admire. I dont want to potentially jeopardize anything academically or professionally. So I guess Im asking this:

Students, if a professor inadvertently made you extremely uncomfortable, how would you approach them about it?

And

Professors, how would you prefer a student tell you about something you said that accidentally made them uncomfortable?",college,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17khjm5/advice_on_professor/

I was taking 5 classes, Calculus, Bio 1 (Recitation + Lab), English Comp, Chem 1 (Recitation + Lab), and a basic intro to university class. I was struggling in chemistry, so I dropped calculus in order to focus on it. Even though I had a B+ in the class. Big mistake. Last time I take advice from an advisor. Its getting to the point where its looking like I have to drop chemistry regardless. Itll knock me down to 9 credits. But I plan on transferring colleges next semester anyway. So its unlikely itll affect me. At least thats what financial aid told me. This chem professor has been reported on numerous occasions, including students and coaches. This is due to the majority of the class failing. The only way you could pass that class is if you were in an AP chemistry course prior or taken a chemistry course at a community college prior to coming. Regardless. The material is stressful, boring, and overbearing. And I cant see myself doing anything in the medical field for the next couple years. Ive been to school events this semester where Ive met doctors and nurses. And I just cant see myself doing anything like that. 

I do work two jobs in order to afford all the fees. Im constantly stressed and I feel like I dont have any time for myself or my family. I know college isnt supposed to be easy.

I(20M) recently moved out into my first apartment a few months ago, with two roommates(19M 19F, lets call them M and F). F has her own room and keeps to herself 99% of the time. She has her own fridge, I never really see her cooking so thats her own business. Me and M share a room, and the mini fridge in the kitchen is ours. M is not a bad roommate, he is not a dirty person, a little messy but not enough to get in my way at all. I used to be a messy person before I moved out - now Im a lot more organized simply because I have to be. 
The thing is, both M and F have a much higher dirty tolerance than me. Weeks will go by without the bathroom being cleaned, they will tolerate the shower being grungy, dishes wont be washed for days at a time. Im the kind of person who, after I cook, I clean right away. They are not. I frequently come home exhausted from school (we are all in college) just to have to do a pile of dishes for all of us because I know that if I dont, it wont get done, at least not before I actually need to use the kitchen for something. Same with the bathroom - I deep clean it once a week (sink, toilet, shower, everything) because I cant stand seeing it get gross meanwhile nobody else lifts a finger. For context - no, me and my roommates werent really friends before. If anything I have grown really close to M, enough so that I kind of see him like a younger brother. I also know he has a much tougher workload than me and he is tired all the time, if anything he is also depressed. This is no excuse not to take care of our apartment but, I have empathy because I care about him so much. For F, I barely see her let alone tell her about anything cleaning related. And theres no just let it be and see how bad it gets until they clean - I clean this much because otherwise its deeply uncomfortable to exist in the only place thats mine. I care about my home, no matter how small it is, its all we have. M always offers to clean more, and is always apologizing and saying he feels bad because I clean so much. I dont really get any thank yous though. If I was actually appreciated for what I do or something maybe it would be different& I feel stuck because this is a year long lease.

He is a sophomore and started off as ok but seemed sort of difficultl. He immediately had us change the room the moment I walked through the door and set a very strict roommate agreement with lights off, bed times, no light at night, room always cold ect. That is fine with me even though I don't like the rooms cold. 

A few weeks ago he mentioned that he was using cocaine over the weekend without me prompting. Now I'm in the business of minding my business so I didn't push or ask, I just let it go. This past weekend, however, he stayed up all night and at 5 am he got up. I began hearing some banging noises and then he proceeded to snort several lines of crack. He then began entering and exiting the room, playing music really loud and stuff like that for the next few hours. I no longer feel safe with him or feel like I can set boundaries or maintain them properly at all. 

Problem is at my college it's really hard to find a room because it's a big college and anyone who is lucky enough to have their own room, (there are several on my floor), won't want to give it up. I have zero friends here so I can't move in with them and I can't afford a private room. I don't know what to do. Don't want to report because I have no idea if he even has more on him or what. 

Tl;Dr My roommate started out fine but it has escalated to him doing crack in the room and I no longer feel comfortable being around him or confronting him about breaking boundaries of the roommate agreement.

Update: My dad talked to some people who have had kids in college and what he said was if I go to my RA and tell them that we have different moral values and I no longer feel safe being in the room, the college should do their best to move me. And if they press for more information I tell them I'm not comfortable telling them why and I am not interested in having a mediated discussion with my roommate.

My (18M/NB) roommate (18F) and i got along well when we were texting over the summer, and i assumed things would be fine. Everything was good until mid-Septemberish when she hooked up with people on two separate occasions with me in the room (i was awake for one, asleep for the other) up until this point, she was insistent that she would never do anything like this ever. I was awake when she hooked up with this girl (her now girlfriend), and she told me that they werent even gonna share her bed, and that her guest would sleep on the floor. Ive had a lot of struggles with sexual abuse in my life so these events were really triggering, especially hearing about how she hooked up with someone while i was asleep. i told our RA, who had me file a title nine violation against my roommate and both of the other girls, then we had a meeting with our RA about this whole situation. Since then, my roommate has hardly been back to our room for any longer than 12 hours, which isnt something i asked of her. 

on friday, her parents came and visited and she brought back a bunch of leftovers, and she asked if she could put them in the fridge (i brought i and i primarily use it), and i said yeah of course. well, theres something in her food that i am very allergic to, to the point that i couldnt even drink the water out of my brita without giving me a reaction. our RA told us that if there were issues we could write notes to each other, so i wrote her a note that said exactly this.

hey, im really allergic to something in your leftovers which is not your fault, but i would really appreciate you getting them out of the fridge.

i asked a couple friends who know the extent of everything, and they said it got the message across clearly and kindly. well i came back to our room between two of my classes, and she has reheated some of her leftovers, making my room essentially toxic for me to go into. am i wrong for wanting to contact our RA again? i spend a lot of time in there and i cant move. because of safety reasons, yet she has stated she doesnt need to be on the floor were on (gender inclusive floor).",college,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17jz1n5/do_i_have_a_bad_roommate_or_am_i_just_being/

I came home for the Diwali festival, but am currently dreading the idea of going back to my hostel room and dealing with the stress again. The coursework is insanely tough and I hate how competitive everyone is out there. Not to mention the god-awful inconsiderate professors out there who keep insanely hard quizzes, tests, lab evals, assignments, vivas every fucking week. They teach jack-shit and expect everyone to ace ridiculously tough evals. Everywhere I go I get involved in conversations about GPAs, grades and facing the cutthroat competition of securing a job in a company. It's like everyone's forgotten that there's more to life than that. It's not that I don't have friends; i have a good number of dudes I hang out with often. But the discussions and gossip with them is not something I really look forward to. They give me anxiety and panic attacks. Not to mention the awful food in the mess and the number of times I fall sick during the semester. I haven't had a single night of peaceful sleep in my entire college life. My eyes don't close till 4 or 5 in the morning, and I wake up in the afternoon having missed most of the classes. My body doesn't feel good for the entire day after that.

I met two girls from one of the clubs and found of that we have a class in common. I gave them my study material (I figured that would make us closer) and we made plans to hang out after the exam. After the exam they texted to ask when I am free, and after I invited them to do something, they never responded to my text (in the group chat with all 3 of us). I felt very used by these girls. I ended up seing one of the girls in person a week after being ignored and she said she ""forgot to text me""....sure. 

I have a roommate but we aren't best friend level friends. My dorm has a lot of community, expect I am not included and I feel like an outsider because everyone already has their clicks. Before you say ""get involved in your dorm,""....I tried when I applied to help move in freshman and was rejected (love being at a competitive school). 

I don't know what to do. I am so depressed and lonely, I can't even put in effort to try to make more friends because of my depression. Please help.",college,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17hik48/i_have_no_friends_20f/

Im taking an english course, and we were meant to have a 3 page draft of an essay we were assigned finished and printed out by today at 8am. Its currently almost noon for me. We have 8am classes Tuesdays and Thursdays, so we were meant to bring two copies to class for peer review today. He stressed this as being super important.

 I woke up on Tuesday with a sore throat, but thought it was just because I slept with my fan near my face. I went to a museum on campus and started feeling super sick all of a sudden, and laid down on the grass for a couple hours. I was lightheaded and felt like I was going to pass out, and started making my way back to my dorm. It took me nearly two hours when its maybe a 20-25 minute walk maximum. I got back to my dorm and slept, and was in and out of consciousness hallucinating. Like genuinely I was hallucinating stuff in front of me, thinking I had stolen something from the museum, etc. I didnt know wtf was going on and covid tested negative. Yesterday I missed my class because I was genuinely in and out of consciousness that entire day, and my roommates were considering dragging me to the ER because I couldn't even stand and wasn't able to go get food or anything.

 I hadn't eaten in like, two days until about 30 mins ago because I was too weak to go out and get food. I still had planned to go to my 8am english class today because of how important he stressed it was, and was gonna wear a mask and sit away from everyone. I got up at 6 and sometime while I was getting ready in the dorm, I apparently passed out. My roommates came back to find me slumped over against my closet at like 10am when they got back from doing errands. I dont really know what to do now.

 I wish I had emailed my professor and let him know but genuinely I was never awake long enough or lucid enough to even get onto my laptop over the past two days. Im not sure what to tell him now, and worried that my work wont be accepted. What can I say in the email I send him now?

The others who live there are great and I couldnt ask for better, but one suitemate never cleans. Its been 2 months and they havent done their dishes once or helped when we clean the common areas or take out the trash on weekends. They also do not contribute to the shared food supply (they use the most eggs and havent bought eggs once; we live in a high cost of living area). 

Yesterday, it started out like usually if me washing the dishes. It was like 40% mine, 40% my suitemate, and 20% my roommates (I dont mind doing hers because she also does mine). After I finished, I was like f it and asked the suitemate to clean the kitchen to see if they would do anything. Their first response to being asked to help was, Do you have anything going on today? To put it lightly that did not sit well with me. 

We have also been missing a bowl for 2 weeks, and I grew tired of not knowing where it was (they cost 50 cents so like that is not the issue), so I texted the group chat of our suite asking who had the bowl and please put it back. Well this suitemate saw it as a personal attack, to put it lightly. Not even 2 minutes later I get a text from their MOM asking if there were some concerns and offered $100 to help with community expenses. When I didnt immediately reply due to complete shock, I got a text saying she was ordering some new bowls and an electric kettle. When I declined the offer of her buying stuff for us, she then offered to come clean the common areas over thanksgiving break. I of course took her up on the $100 because I was essentially grocery shopping for them for 2 months, and in a subsequent text, she said, In a group some might be caretakers and others might not. EXCUSE ME??!!?!!???!!?? 

I found this whole situation entirely inappropriate. I am going to apologize to them because I did find the bowl in the fridge but the cleaning and grocery shopping, plus the fact THE MOM CONTACTED ME.

My professor is extremely kind and understanding.  From what I understand, nothing in the syllabus implies that he doesn't accept late work. In fact, I remember being in class and him saying ""just turn it in when you can"" in reference to an assignment.

The reason I've been absent for so long is humiliating. I've been dealing with some pretty bad mental health issues and was diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago. I'm also already diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. I've been having constant nightmares, flashbacks, and days without sleep due to intense anxiety and guilt. It started off with missing ""just a few days of class"" to allow myself to recover, but then I became too afraid to show my face again. I am about to start therapy for the first time soon though and I've been taking a prescription to help anxiety and sleep.

The reason I'm so embarrassed is that basically everyone deals with mental health issues. I understand that struggling is valid, but it's not a decent excuse to miss class for a month and expect the professor to let you submit tons of late work. My question is: should I explain my reasoning for missing class to my professor with medical proof? And ask if there's still a possibility of me passing the class if I complete all my late work and consistently attend class from now on? If yes, should I do this over email or in person? Or, should I just take the L and withdraw from the class with a W on my transcript and no refund. The last day to drop the class with a W is October 20th, so 3 days from now.

2023-11-07,1699370059,Hot take: I cant wait to be done with college,"This is probably going to get downvoted, but I need to get this out. To preface this, dont get me wrong, I truly do appreciate having the opportunity to get this education and am beyond grateful to everyone in my life who made this possible. I wouldnt be where I am today without the hard work and sacrifices of so many people throughout so many years.

That being said, for me, college has not been as enjoyable as I hoped it would be. I know its still supposed to be a serious academic environment and its not all just fun and games, but considering the number of people who have told me things like college is SO fun, youre gonna have a blast! and you get so much freedom in college! I guess I feel kind of let down. For starters, I cant help but feel the constant pressure of having to maintain a solid social life because thats such a big part of college. As someone who used to be socially awkward and struggled a lot with making friends, I feel like to this day, I feel especially more anxiety and pressure to keep up a bustling social life due to those past experiences - as if I need to constantly prove to myself that I have friends and Im not a loner. Even in my second year here, though, I still dont really feel like I have as good of a social/party life as I would like, and I dont really have many close friends. Not to mention all the drama that happens between friends and roommates a lot of the time.

Also, at the end of the day- no matter how fun or exciting it can be- its still school, and I still feel just as stressed out, if not more, about all the work I constantly have to do and the looming deadline to declare my major. Plus, applying for internships, job hunting, networking, and all of that other stuff adds even more to that stress. Im not planning on pursuing higher education at this time, either, so I feel like the timeline to find a job is even more tight for me.

To be clear, I really am grateful that I can be here, but I would be lying if I said that I didnt wish I could just fast-forward a few years to graduation. I cant wait to just finally be finished with school, hold down a stable job, have a consistent daily routine, have more free time, and not have to constantly feel pressure to have a ton of friends or keep up a social life and image around other people.",college,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17pwh5a/hot_take_i_cant_wait_to_be_done_with_college/

2023-11-02,1698939682,I hate my major,"For reference, I am a sophomore in college, and my freshman year I switched from engineering to business. I was so excited for engineering and I absolutely loved it. The only reason I changed was due to my crazy first semester schedule including bio, chem, calculus, and history (I suck at history), and as a gifted kid in high school, I didnt know how to study and I ended up having to drop calculus and chemistry. My dad recommended I change majors, and so I did. 

I am now a business major and I absolutely hate it. Its not too hard, but I am so uninterested that I cannot force myself to pay attention. Whats also discouraging is I went to a STEM career fair and adored it but when I went to the business fair I didnt see anything that remotely interested me. 

I want to switch majors, but I dont know what to. I have no life plans and no career goals. I currently work in a bank and already know I dont want to do that for the rest of my life. I dont want to work a desk job, but with business it looks like thats what Im going to be doing. I havent picked a business sector to declare, but school is so draining to me because I know this isnt what I want to do, but I only have scholarships for 4 years of school, and switching now seems like a great way to lose money and stay in school longer. 

I really want to do data science, but at the college I go to, you have to pay for both the engineering and business schools, and that seems so extra. Engineering was going to be a way to get me to do data analysis, but business could do the same. I also like accounting, but I dont want to do a desk job. I want to make a comfortable amount of money as well, otherwise I would be a teacher. I believe Im good at math, but calculus was awful, and Im taking an online statistic like class right now and not doing well (which I blame the teacher and my lack of interest for). I dont want to be in school forever, so med and law school are out of the picture.  

Should I switch majors? If so what to? Are there any non desk jobs that business majors can receive? Should I just suck it up and finish since I have two years? I dont want college to be a bad experience for me.

People tend to get annoyed with me for putting in any kind of extra effort, and it's making me start to resent school and I wish it didn't.

\----

I've always really liked learning for as long as I can remember. I always thought that college would be full of other people like me because people finally get to learn about things they really care about and that are (slightly) more relevant to the real world, but I haven't found more than a handful of people who really care about *learning* as opposed to getting through classes until they get their degree.

I also know that they're probably exhausted and losing interest or that they were just told they need a degree, so they do what they have to to pass. I've tried to find ways to meet other people who do care  and to get people interested via groups and out-of-class discussions too... It just seems like people are more annoyed with me than anything else. 

Even my philosophy professors (I'm a philosophy major) seem to be getting annoyed with the fact that I like to get into a bit more detail (1-2 extra questions/concerns per class, a 10 min conversation during office hours once a week at most) about what parts of the material I agree and disagree with. It seems like they'd rather I just accept the material and move on even though philosophy *is* the subject of questioning things.

Being constantly treated like I'm doing too much for wanting to really *learn* and not regurgitate is making me start to resent school, but I never want to get to the point of giving up on it entirely. Not sure if I should keep trying to learn or just figure out how to be happy doing the bare minimum. I just wish school were about learning again...

Yes it was so bad I was placed in special education for many years. It wasn't until I gained passion for learning what I wanted to do. In which I became better. I am pursuing a degree in biology and may get into more so I can become an astrobiologist. 

  When I look at an IQ test I realize something it's not about how smart you are. It's about how well you can learn and how fast you can problem solve.  

  I'm mentioning IQ because I understand either you feel your dumb or you took an IQ test that says your dumb.  I think I can explain but best. 

  Imagine a genius 140 IQ he reads what he learns and advanced really quick to the next part, A guy with average intelligence will probably have to read it once or twice maybe take some notes and a 2 hour assignment takes them well 2 hours maybe 3 hours. 

  Now people like us who are mentally challenged. It's rough and that's something you are gonna have to understand. You are gonna have to watch videos on what your learning, read it, take notes, review it for a very long time and all for most of that information to flush out because we don't have a good memory capacity. Sleep and Eating? Barely because well your too busy learning materials that should take only  well no more than like 4 hours in multiple classes. It takes a average person 2x reading to learn it will take you about 10x if that makes sense. 

  I love learning I love it so much. However, it's been a complete nightmare mentally draining feeling like I'm not good enough but I keep pushing and pushing learning and learning.

I basically finished high school as a social outcast with no friends and severe social anxiety, which carried over into college.  I'm a junior now, and I spent my first two years completely terrified of talking to people for fear of them thinking I'm weird, creepy or them being straight up mean to me.  In the second half of my sophomore year I met a guy who is a massive social butterfly, and meeting him kind of boosted my confidence since he made a real effort to hang out with me.  I met a few people because of him and even got my first girlfriend (although it ended up being a pretty short relationship).  Anyway, the real magic has come this semester.  I have met so many people, a lot of them through my own efforts now, and I've found that it's actually pretty easy to just start a conversation with someone.  Most people are pretty nice and willing to give you the time of day, at least at my college.  I kind of feel like I wasted my first two years because I had so many opportunities to talk to people and get to know them, but I pushed all of those people away because I feared rejection.

When I went to speak to him after class he told me its because there was a question I did that wasnt assigned. I asked him what he meant and he showed me. Long story short, I misread and did question 26 instead of 36. He has a rule that something like that results in an automatic zero. I didnt really get it at first, and I said oh so I just got that answer wrong then, and he said no you got a zero. Then I realized he meant I got a zero for the entire homework set. 

I didnt really believe him at first, but he said its a rule he as its a way hes found students cheating off of each other in the past.

I told him Id rather he think I was stupid than I cheated, and I didnt cheat. He told me since I confronted him he doesnt think I cheated and that if I hadnt spoken to him he wouldve thought otherwise. Then I started to cry, just because I was feeling overwhelmed, the class is difficult, and I really need to pass the class in order to take the next set of classes. Then I started to cry more because I was embarrassed. He told me not to cry and that I would be fine, and that he would assign a bonus homework. He said I made a blunder, which arent allowed in the real world and to think of it as a learning experience.

I tried to get it together but couldnt and was more embarrassed and cried some more. Then I just dipped without saying bye, and I feel bad.

Today it took roughly a minute for a student to step up and volunteer to just pass out papers to the class&. So my question is, as a student, do you see these behaviors as well in yourself or classmates? Is this because of the pandemic era of fully online classes?

2023-10-27,1698422167,my class has an absolutely ridiculous attendance policy,"Someone please try to understand the logic of this attendance policy. Now my class has lecture twice a week and a discussion section once a week. We have an attendance grade that's worth 10% of our grade for lecture and an attendance/participation grade worth 20% for our discussion classes. 

Now in the syllabus it states that every absence from class results in a 10% grade deduction of your overall grade. That seemed completely illogical because whats the point of an attendance grade if you get docked a whole letter grade for missing class anyways right? So I went ahead and asked one of the TAs about that at the beginning of the semester and they told me that that policy only applies to our discussion sections which made sense to me. 

Now midway through the semester after I've already missed countless lectures but 0 discussion classes, I'm being told that the policy applies to lectures as well......

Whats the point of an attendance grade if you're losing a whole ass letter grade for missing class anyways?!?!?!

Edit: After some backlash, I wanted to clarify some things. I asked a TA about this policy **before** I started missing classes, and they explicitly told me that it did not apply to lectures. I also asked a separate TA a few weeks into class to double check, and they told me the same thing. If I was not misled with false information, I wouldn't have missed a single class, although I still think the policy is too harsh.

What had me most upset was that the prof saw the AI similarity score on the draft as well and didn't even talk to me about it. I just don't think it's very fair to give me the ok to keep going with my draft if it had a false positive too.

I'm actively redoing this next essay because I'm genuinely afraid that it will get flagged too. If I get another false positive, there's a good chance I'll lose my scholarship.

What to do when your professor asks questions on quizzes and exams that they never went over in lecture? 

This is an ongoing thing with all of her exams and quizzes, and she offers no extra credit for the class. 

Example: we learned in class that cooking cast iron increases iron absorption.

On the quiz: what increases iron absorption? 

The answer: cooking in cast iron and using acidic sauces.

Not once did she mention acidic sauces in class and there is no way this is a critical thinking Q with what shes taught. 

This isnt the only example I have but she locks the exams so I cant go look back at the specific questions. I am trying to remember the Q better now that I know she has answers she never taught. 

Another ex of how she asks questions: infants need 9 essential amino acids, adults need 8  (learned in lecture)

Question: how many amino acids do adults and infants need? (I remember this Q specifically bc I had to think it through)

I answered 8, she said the answer was 9(when I asked what I got wrong). I feel like this was a trick question?? Because both need 8, not 9. 

I emailed her about it and she didnt respond. I looked up her rate my professor and this is a common theme in this class and her more advanced class too (I will be paying $$$ to take the class anywhere else than with her next semester). She asks things she never discussed in lecture and sometimes the questions/answers are wrong. 

With the recent Q on cast iron, I asked for credit for the answer I gave because she never went over acidic sauces in class. 

Exact message: Cooking with acidic sauces was not taught in class lecture and there is no mention of it in the notes. Is there a way I could please receive credit for this question? I went back and re-watched the lectures as well as looking through my notes thoroughly and there is no mention of cooking with acidic sauces. Using cast iron is the only thing you taught us so there is no way I knew that. Thank you, name

I have been outed to at least 30 other students by a professor in the past, I'm not sure if that information got spread around or not.

I'm on campus and away from my apartment for hours a day, and the closest gender neutral bathroom is a 10 minute walk. I'm extremely anxious about using the men's restrooms in the building my classes are in - I don't know how people would react if they noticed a trans person in the bathroom with them. Is that something anyone really gives a fuck about, as long as I just piss, wash my hands, and leave? Should I just walk to the neutral restrooms and hope they're not occupied?

Edit: to everyone telling me to use the women's bathroom, keep in mind that I genuinely just look like a man, beard and all. I am *not* visibly trans. I look like a cis, genetic, biological, whatever-you-want-to-call-it *man.* You do not actually want people like me in the women's room.",college,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17lbhjm/anxiety_about_using_public_bathrooms_at_college/

2023-10-19,1697742665,My professor seems to be scamming the university,"Im taking intro to statistics for data analysis. Were supposed to learn statistics and how to code in a programming language called R.

The guy just does not teach. Hes an instructor rather than an associate professor or anything higher. He doesnt have lesson plans; he doesnt have a syllabus; he doesnt record and post his lectures online like every other instructor/prof at the school; he doesnt answer email; its unbelievably bad.

Weve had ONE graded assignment in 2 months of class and the assignment used multiple concepts that arent in our textbook that havent been taught in-class. The class average is 49%. The one assignment was due 9/24 and we didnt get it back until today, 10/19. The withdrawal deadline is only 8 days away, no refunds of course. ~70% of the class has a failing grade. The instructor said verbatim that there will be no grade curve on anything in the course. 

The guys lectures are him holding a 2L of Diet Coke while he rambles about his personal and work history. Hell tell us a story about how statistics apply to reporting the weather or something else totally unrelated to what were supposed to be learning. Sometimes hell show us how to solve some complicated statistics problem that has close to no basis or no basis at all to whats in our textbook; the class just stares at him with glazed over eyes because were all thinking how the hell are we supposed to follow any of this. We havent been introduced to any formulas, vocabulary, or anything meaningful. 

I emailed the department head once and the head got him to post a barebones syllabus on Canvas but theres been no other improvement. 

I feel like Ive been scammed out of $1200 and a W on my transcript will look pretty bad. My other classes are hard and some of the lectures arent great but theres always clearly defined expectations, a robust syllabus, various resources for self-teaching, etc. so I can always pull through with a B by working hard and self-teaching. 

This is his first year at this university. Im setting up an in-person meeting with the department head to talk about it but I dont see how things could be remedied at this point. This is extremely frustrating and stressful.

He was the younger brother of another upperclassmen.  If he was a student he would have been a freshman like I was.  He was a pretty annoying person who constantly hung around everyone else acting like a student and he seemed to want to be treated like a student too which rubbed me the wrong way.  Daily, he would often just go apartment to apartment hanging with whoever is there being loud and annoying.

2023-10-24,1698142570,Sunk 5 hours into two essays for them to count towards my grade.,"Edit: sunk five hours into two different essays just for them to not count towards any grade (even final grade)


Does anyone consistently do work for it not even count towards anything numerical in the class?

Yesterday I had two exams, one which I studied for about 25 hours, the other three hours. Then I had work- just a six hour shift. Then I get back home to spend five hours on writing essays that aren't even being graded. I think I went to bed at 1 just to go to clinical at 5. I'm running on four hours of sleep, I'm so cold and so exhausted. This is every week, doing the shit for this stupid art class which has more work involved than my pharmacology course. 

I'm a nursing student, I am past the point of caring about getting good grades, I just want to pass my non-core classes.

Should I talk to the prof? I'm not at work enough, I'm getting in trouble for not making the hours, I don't have enough time to study, I don't have enough time do spend on things that don't count for a grade. 

I'm a junior, my last 3.2 semesters. What do I even do?

Edit: okay, since some of you have issues with my post I'm going to make this crystal clear. 

Yes I am doing two degrees at once, yes this is possible. Look it up, lots of bachelor programs are partnering with different schools connected to magnet hospitals. I will graduate with my associates next may, and my bachelors the next may after that. Hence why I'm focused on my nursing courses and not my gen Ed's. Thank you so much to the person that pointing out my grammatical mistakes. I'm so sorry that I made this post when I was upset and on four hours of sleep and also on the OB surgical floor (high acuity if you're not in the medical field). So I was quite busy at the time and no my professional writing does not look like that. I am taking 19 credits, this art class is one credit, my clinical are 8 credits, my lab is 1 credit, my pharm course is three credits, my OB/PEDS/ MED SURGE course is three credits and I'm also taking a philosophy course for three credits. Im trying to finish my bachelors as fast as possibly, I never take a break, I take one class every winter break and three classes over summer. I've always done this and yes it sucks but school sucks and I want to get it over with. 

This class is not an art history course, it's called art anatomy where we have to pick events that we do essays and class presentations on, so every week two essays and two presentations plus traveling to an art Museum/ show to gather data. All in all this class takes me about 8 hours per week just to do the bare minimum. Which seems excessive since that's not accounting for the three hours of class time that it takes up during the week.

For those of you who encouraged me to talk to my prof, I did end up going to her in person after class. They do count for a grade, she was just using the wrong syllabus attached to the course (how do you not notice that you have uploaded the wrong document for a particular class is beyond me). So, yes I got it worked out with her, and now I don't feel as terrible about me ""wasting time"". 

And everyone that is saying ""if MLA is so easy why did it take you five hours"", this paper was five pages long, single spaced and a small font (in respect to the profs paper policy). Complete with citations, headers and formatting it takes a while to make. For all of you that say MLA is easy, in comparison it is, to APA. I've never been trained to do APA, even in high school and middle school everything was MLA all day. I've been writing in this format since- fifth grade. That was 8 years ago so by god, I would HOPE that I know how to do it by now.

I also worked in a hospital drawing blood and stuff and have a very good side hustle working with antique human skeletons (essentially museum conservation).

Now Ill get into why I feel like college is a waste, I have taken soo many classes, and its just like highschool. You take a class that has nothing to do with what youll do in a career and throw everything away that you learned once the semester is over. You do the real learning on the job, I worked with nurses that didnt remember anything important from college, I have had to teach them things in the hospital (I dont have a degree Im just a nobody). I swear I have met so many people with degrees that dont know much of anything. Also what really angers me is how there is no standard in colleges, each professor essentially writes their own rules. My chemistry professor made a pass/fail system 80% or more on each quiz to get a point. Any lower than 80% and youd get a 0%. Take the same class with a different professor, and the whole grading system is different. Go to the same class at a different college and it is taught completely differently. No standard at all. I have learned so much outside of college and have made wayyy more connections outside of college, I have grown wayyy more without college. I believe I can be successful without having a degree, seems like a waste of time.

Im just going to add that nobody in my family has a degree but some of my family members currently work on college boards. Funny huh no degree and making decisions for the college. Colleges are just a business trying to take as much money as they can.

They would walk around and you could ask for help with a question if you didn't understand it. Something like that.

2023-10-18,1697650451,Mentally ill roommate: pls help,"I share a small dorm with another girl. Were both in our early 20s and live thousands of miles from our families for context. 

I was supposed to live off campus this year with a friend, but stuff happened and the apartment fell through so we both had to move back on campus. Since we switched living situations so late, we both had to go random for roommates. Thats how I ended up with this girl, P. 

When I moved in, P told me she was a senior. It became apparent very quickly that she didnt have any friends. I also figured out that she had a very severe binge eating disorder and depression. 

I tried to be friends with her. I invited her everywhere I went with my own friends and she always declined. 

Sometimes she will be sweet, and then she will have an uptick in her mental health issues and take it out on me. Think screaming at me out of the blue for things out of my control (like political issues, global events, etc) and hurl verbal abuse at me for existing (mind you the room is usually silent before she starts literally screaming). 

We have gotten a noise complaint for her screaming before too. 

She has told me that in the past she would get depressed and make up stuff about her classmates so they would get kicked out of their activities and be sad like her 

We have lived here since august and she has never done laundry. I can count on my hands how many times I have seen her go to class. All she does is rot in bed, watch YouTube videos and tiktok for 12 hours a day and binge eat.

She also has an online boyfriend who is clearly a scammer but were not even going to get into that. 

Anyway, weve begun to have an issue with the room smelling. Its probably from the amount of dirty laundry, trash and rotting food on her side of the room. Every time I try to clean up a bit she screams at me to stay in my lane. The issue is some of the trash is making its way onto my side of the room so it is within my lane to clean it. 

Since she ran out of clothes, she started using mine as well as my makeup, hair products, etc. 

I think she even sleeps in my bed when Im not there because I dont have trash on it. 

I have tried to set boundaries but nothing has stuck. The RA is involved and he cant get through to her either. The school doesnt want to escalate anything because her father donates a ton of money (he is a multi millionaire in Asia) and wont jeopardize losing their paycheck from him. Everything is documented, its just nobody wants to DO anything. 

The school said I could switch dorms at the semester mark, but until then all the dorms are full so I have to make do. 

I just have no idea what to do until December. I basically live in a depression room which is starting to effect my mental health a ton. I also feel like a burden to my friends since Im at their places almost everyday. 

Im afraid she will make stuff up about me to get me kicked out of activities like she has done to others in the past if I keep trying to put up boundaries. It doesnt help that shes openly Islamophobic and Im Muslim and have Muslim stuff in the room. Also yes, I did tell the school about that and they said Im probably misunderstanding her and that everyone is panicked with the Hamas stuff rn. 

I also feel really bad for her. Her family is thousands of miles away and shes clearly so mentally ill and need support. 

I just feel so trapped. All my roommates in the past have been so lovely so this is completely uncharted territory for me

My nose bleeds can range from a few spots, to a dripping gushing mess. This one started as a few drops so I used a tissue and plugged it. Few minutes later it bled through. I replaced the tissue and threw out the old one, then tried to get back on with my test. Again, not even 2 minutes later I bled through it and I was out of tissues. I had reached the visible pour of blood and didn't want to make the room a biohazard or disturb anyone. My professor was sitting at the back of the room (I was at the front) so I guess he didn't fully see what was happening but he let me go.

I was in the bathroom for about 10 minutes cleaning up and trying to stop the bleeding and make sure I wasn't going to pass out or anything. Once it was controlled, I went back to the room and had about 25 minutes of the test left. When I finished (+ I used some accommodation time lol), I went to turn it in and my professor stopped me.

He pretty much told me that he was going to talk with the other physics department members, my advisor, and possibly other admin members since he suspected me of cheating. His reasoning? I had my phone in my pocket when I went to the bathroom. It was off and everything, but it was enough suspicion to warrant me possibly failing this exam, or even getting other large scale consequences.

The best part, is that I wont have a chance to defend myself or know jack shit about this until the end of the month because tomorrow marks the first day of fall interim. 

So yeah Im getting black out tonight to cope but yup, I hate everything right now and I don't know what to do lol.

2023-10-27,1698369652,I got reported to campus police and Im freaking out (sorry for the wall of text),"I usually drive a small Chevy impala to school, but a couple days ago it was taken for an inspection so I had to use our old gmc truck. Im insured on the truck and its registered with my parking pass, but I had only driven it a couple times previous. When I was parking it, the lot was packed and there was very little room to maneuver. I bumped the door of a truck when trying to park (I was going very slow, my foot on the breaks) when I got out I didnt see any damage so I went to classes for about 4 hours then went home. Today I got a call from campus university police that they wanted to ask me a few questions about an incident a few days ago. I didnt realize it was about the morning with the truck until I got there and they told me (they read me my rights and recorded the conversation). Im pretty sure the truck I bumped filed a report on me. I explained that I didnt think there was any damage and I was unaware that I caused any, to which the officer responded he would turn me over to student conduct and they would decide punishment. Sorry for the rambling but Im freaking out and I dont know what to do. He didnt give me the other drivers information or even tell me the damage I caused so I dont know in terms of insurance whats going to happen. Im really hoping they dont revoke my parking pass because I dont know how I would get to classes without it.

2023-11-03,1698972251,Accidentally Got Accepted To A School,"So I'm aware that the title sounds strange, since obviously I applied to get into a college but hear me out. 

I'm a senior in high school, so I've been applying to a lot of colleges. I have my main handful that I'd actually want to go and then a bunch of safety school. All of my safety school were free to apply to, and I didn't do much research on them since I don't actually intend on accepting any of their offers.

One of my safety schools got back to me with an acceptance letter and a 40k scholarship (10k each year), so I'm really happy. I ended up looking up the school for the first time, just to find out it's a competitive private school with a 55% acceptance rate.

Now I'm smart, but my grades don't reflect it. I have a 2.4 accumulated GPA and struggle in school. How I got accepted and got a scholarship is beyond me, but now I might be going to a private school >7<ü@

Edit: I won't be in a dorm since a family member offered me her spare room if I do accept since she lives really close.

2023-11-06,1699279068,Unhygienic Dining Hall,"My college's dining halls are notoriously not great. Not just the questionable combinations of food (PB and J chicken wings? why?), but food poisoning is a decently common issue, especially at one of the halls. I still eat there cause there are not many choices, but yesterday broke me.

I like to use the ice machine and I understand they are never super clean. However, there was a dangling piece of black slime coming out of the machine. It was not rubber or a piece of the machine but honest-to-god slime. I ran out of the dining hall to retch and didn't go back cause obviously someone would've noticed that. I know the staff members use the ice machine and it was *not* subtle. 

This morning I go for breakfast and it's still there. I finally alert the supervisor and I watch as she just wipes it off with a napkin and pretends like it's fine. No bleach or sanitizer. No closing down the machine. I feel sick, this could make people seriously ill. I can't get in contact with the head of dining services or find who it is in the first place. 

Any suggestions on what to do? Would I be insane to contact the health department? 

Edit: Reported to the Health Department and while I didn't get any photos, I talked with staff from a different dining hall (that's never had issues with food poisoning). Several of the staff previously worked there and said they would back up my claims on poor hygiene.
